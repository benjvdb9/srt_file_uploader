<i>[Goblin: The Lonely and Great God]</i>

Subtitles by DramaFever

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,302
若灵魂附在某人的旧物

5
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,605
或沾了血的物件上

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,041
便会成为鬼怪

7
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:44,620
上过无数战场 染过鲜血的长剑

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,258
沾染上了主人的血更甚

9
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:02,633
<i>If a spirit inhabits an object that has
the touch or the blood of a human on it</i>

10
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,933
<i>the spirit becomes a goblin.</i>

11
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:10,712
唯有鬼怪的新娘 才可拔出此剑

12
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:15,751
拔出剑之后 一切归于无 便可安息

13
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,933
<i>And this was a sword
from a battlefield</i>

14
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,843
<i>with the blood of thousands on it</i>

15
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,023
<i>with even its own owner's blood on
it, so it was only to be expected.</i>

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,032
这是恶毒的神谕

17
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:33,701
而以不死之身重生的鬼怪

18
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:37,239
在这世上亦有亦无

19
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>And only the bride of the goblin will
be able to pull out that sword.</i>

20
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,308
此刻也在某...

21
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,646
笑什么 死丫头

22
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,503
<i>And when the sword is pulled out</i>

23
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:48,323
<i>he will become nothing
once more, and rest in peace.</i>

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,150
此刻 也可能在某处寻找着新娘

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,885
而那个新娘... 就是我

26
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:51,453
你是想这么说的吗

27
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:53,956
别看我现在这样

28
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:56,725
年轻时可是俘获了不少男人的心

29
00:01:56,725 --> 00:02:00,262
下次来时若我不在了 你可别吃惊

30
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,323
Of course, this is a cruel
deal for the goblin.

31
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,264
真是羡慕啊

32
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,823
The goblin, which woke up
to realize that it is immortal

33
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,267
我真是老糊涂了

34
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,403
跟你这个未婚妈妈炫耀这些

35
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,533
is everywhere and nowhere in
this world at the same time

36
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,423
and even now, nobody
knows where he may be...

37
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,607
真坏

38
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,575
菠菜 白菜都给你算便宜了

39
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:15,744
我还坏

40
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,633
Why the hell are you laughing, girl?

41
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:19,214
是抛弃你的那个混蛋坏才是

42
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:23,423
Are you about to tell me, "He's still
looking for his bride, and it's me"?

43
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,851
那倒是

44
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:26,321
不过这个故事好伤感

45
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,423
Even though I look like this now, I had
hordes of men following me in my prime!

46
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,090
有何伤感的

47
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,859
是一个浪漫而怨毒的诅咒

48
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:32,423
Don't come back next time
only to be surprised to find me gone.

49
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,595
为求死而寻找新娘

50
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,923
Wow, I'm so jealous.

51
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,765
神真坏

52
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,423
I'm just getting old.

53
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,268
神原本就不是好惹的

54
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,233
That's not something for me to
brag about in front of you, though.

55
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,404
自私 善妒

56
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,823
Hey, that's not nice!

57
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,740
唯我独尊

58
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:47,533
No, I'm not! I give you discounts
on spinach and cabbage!

59
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:49,244
和某人真像

60
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,033
The bastard who left you behind
and ran off is the not nice one here.

61
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:53,048
我走了 祝您生意兴隆

62
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,733
You do have a point.

63
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,752
下次来 您也一定要在哦

64
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,033
But you know, that story is too sad.

65
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,323
Ha, sure.

66
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:03,123
It's really a romantic sort of curse.

67
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,726
危在旦夕时

68
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,923
I mean, he has to find
his bride in order to die.

69
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:10,165
你要虔诚祷告

70
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,133
God is cruel.

71
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,423
God has always been cruel.

72
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,600
可能某位心慈的神

73
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,533
And he's selfish and jealous too.

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,470
会听到你的祷告

75
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,533
God only cares about himself.

76
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,133
He's just like another
guy we know, huh?

77
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,133
Well, I'll be going now.
I hope you sell a lot.

78
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,233
And you'd better be
here next time too, okay?

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,622
换做是我 不会这么做

80
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,456
你若现在离开家

81
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,033
When you're in a position in which
your life is flashing before your eyes

82
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,692
就会过上比现在更糟糕的生活

83
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,093
可能会再也见不到你妈妈

84
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,923
pray for mercy
with all your heart.

85
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,428
你是谁

86
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,229
韩国人吗

87
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,930
一言难尽

88
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:45,733
<i>Because a god with a soft spot
may be listening to you.</i>

89
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
现在该你了

90
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,236
逐字逐句地说清楚

91
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,323
<i>[PARIS, 1968]</i>

92
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:47,970
告诉他 既然领养了我

93
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,605
你便是我的父亲

94
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,373
所以 你该好好抚养我

95
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:54,042
去求你妈妈 让她帮你

96
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:54,743
告诉她你的痛苦

97
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:56,111
你在胡说八道什么

98
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,879
让开

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,316
提醒你一句 那样割脉只能废了手臂却死不了

100
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,151
你是谁

101
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:04,153
看着他 逐字逐句地说

102
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,533
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

103
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,487
能做到吗

104
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,222
要是被打死了怎么办

105
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,033
If you run away from home now, you'll
live with worse people than that.

106
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,757
你负责吗

107
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,626
所以我帮你弄断了他的肋骨

108
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,233
And you'll never see
your mother again.

109
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,123
Who the hell are you?
Are you Korean?

110
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,895
你个混蛋...

111
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,033
I'm a more complicated person
than you'd think.

112
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,733
It's your turn now.

113
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,333
Go and tell him clearly

114
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,733
"You've adopted me, so you're my father.
So you have to raise me well."

115
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:21,470
这是便当

116
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,604
等谈完了上学去

117
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,973
第17道数学题答案不是2 而是4

118
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,833
And ask your mother for help too.
And tell her you're in pain.

119
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,208
那道题不能错

120
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,711
你到底是谁

121
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,123
What kind of bull are you spouting?
Get the hell out of my way!

122
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,333
And slitting your wrist like
that won't kill you

123
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,833
but it'll render your hand
useless, so be aware of that.

124
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,333
Who are you?

125
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,123
Don't avoid his gaze
and speak clearly.

126
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,423
Can you do that?

127
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:41,233
And what if he beats me to death?
Will you take responsibility?

128
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,833
That's why I broke his rib for you.

129
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,733
You little bastard!

130
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:49,498
他是水 是火 是风

131
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,734
是光明 是黑暗

132
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,623
That's lunch for you.

133
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,870
也曾是...

134
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,833
Go to school
after you're done talking to him.

135
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,233
The answer for number 17
on the math quiz isn't 2. It's 4.

136
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,533
You got that question wrong, so...

137
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,833
Who... are you, really?

138
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,946
人类

139
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:20,923
<i>He's water, wind, and fire.</i>

140
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,623
<i>Light and darkness.</i>

141
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,833
<i>And at one time...</i>

142
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:34,143
百姓称他为神

143
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,123
<i>he was human.</i>

144
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:43,452
闯过血雨腥风 杀敌无数

145
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,958
当得起武神二字

146
00:05:49,147 --> 00:06:01,147


147
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,033
<i>His subjects called him "God."</i>

148
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:17,123
<i>He cut down his foes
covered in crimson blood</i>.

149
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:22,123
<i>And he was a military man
through and through.</i>

150
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,256
金信将军万岁...

151
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:04,093
万岁...

152
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,497
金信将军万岁...

153
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:11,800
将军万岁...

154
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,705
万岁...

155
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,513
打开城门

156
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:28,317
金信将军 凯旋

157
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:31,653
金信卸下戎装

158
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:35,123
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

159
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,159
大胆 竟敢出言不逊

160
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,229
正七品别将竟敢对上将军...

161
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:43,833
- Hooray for the general!
- Hooray for the general!

162
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,832
明君的叛臣金信 卸下戎装

163
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,501
竟敢...

164
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,403
好

165
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,572
等着

166
00:08:54,933 --> 00:09:00,433
Step aside! It's the great
General Kim Shin!

167
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,123
Kim Shin will take off his armor
and heed the king's royal decree.

168
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,987
可以了吗

169
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:06,688
逆臣金信

170
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,523
I dare you to say
that again, punk!

171
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:09,391
弃剑 跪下领旨

172
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,393
我非割下你的舌头...

173
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:12,623
How dare some political
lackey like you oppose...

174
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,263
何来的逆臣 疯了不成

175
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:16,123
The criminal Kim Shin will
take off his armor and...

176
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,331
失心疯不成

177
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,623
How dare you!

178
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,023
I heard you loud and clear.
Wait there.

179
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,141
将军

180
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,709
逆臣 金信

181
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,013
弃剑跪下...

182
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:36,552
本将军要见殿下 让开

183
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,733
Happy now?

184
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:37,486
罪臣金信...

185
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,733
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees

186
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:40,222
挡我者死

187
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,225
让开

188
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,933
and heed the king's royal decree.

189
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,333
I'll pull that rotten tongue
of yours right out!

190
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,733
"Criminal Kim Shin"?
Are you out of your damn mind?

191
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,123
Are you insane?

192
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:58,107
救命啊

193
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,623
General.

194
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:02,333
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees...

195
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:01,376
救命啊

196
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,848
你们这帮家伙

197
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,123
I'm going to see the king.
Get out of my way.

198
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:09,384
以主君之名已战了3天3夜

199
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,933
- Criminal Kim Shin...
- If you don't move, you'll surely die.

200
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,688
好不容易才从人间地狱活着回来

201
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,733
Step aside.

202
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:16,992
可是你们... 你们竟敢...

203
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,962
打开城门

204
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,605
守在他们身边

205
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:32,474
我去去就来

206
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,833
You bastards!

207
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,733
These men fought
for three straight nights!

208
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,523
They were just on their way
back from that hell!

209
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:49,123
So how dare you...
how dare you bastards!

210
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:52,333
Open the castle gates!

211
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,933
Stay here and watch over the men.

212
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,933
I'll be right back.

213
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:07,476
百姓之上是王

214
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,311
王之上是神

215
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:13,015
据说那神就是指金信

216
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,392
他打了无数胜仗 蛊惑了百姓

217
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,895
他的权势再三嘲弄王室

218
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:31,533
请以国法严加惩处

219
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,304
他

220
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,807
虽能看清敌人的刀刃

221
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:42,333
They say that he's like a king among
the people and regarded as a god.

222
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:43,112
但没能看出年轻君王对自己的嫉妒和恐惧

223
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,833
And his name is Kim Shin.

224
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:52,154
那是 指向自己的最锋利的刀刃

225
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,833
<i>That man's endless ascension to power
is making the citizens rise up</i>

226
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,458
可惜他没能看清

227
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>and his power makes a mockery
of the royal family's authority.</i>

228
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,733
So please, issue him the harshest
punishment you can under the law.

229
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,634
真要做到如此地步吗

230
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,402
所以不要再过来

231
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,523
<i>He was able to see the blades
of his opponents quite well</i>

232
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:08,904
停下

233
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:11,907
不管那是什么 都停下

234
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>but he'd been blind to the young
king's fear and jealousy toward him.</i>

235
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,209
停在那里 死于逆贼之名吧

236
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,412
那么除了你之外 可以放过所有人

237
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,615
但是 如果再往前走一步

238
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,523
<i>And he was unaware of the fact</i>

239
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,483
你每迈出一步 每一个眼神

240
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:28,833
<i>that the king's jealousy and fear were
sharper than any blade he'd known.</i>

241
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:25,154
我都会杀了所有人铺在你的脚下

242
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,958
走吧 将军

243
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:37,366
我没关系

244
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,023
So he's really going this far?

245
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,833
Don't step any closer.

246
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,736
我...

247
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,123
Stop right there.

248
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,023
Stop all of it.

249
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:43,572
娘娘 我...

250
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:45,274
我知道

251
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:48,733
Stop right there and die.
If you do, I'll spare everyone else.

252
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,478
我真的全都知道

253
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,833
But if you take even one
more step toward me

254
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,180
如果这就是我的结局

255
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,350
那么这也是我的命运

256
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:56,933
I'll kill everyone in front of you
and lay their corpses at your feet.

257
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,586
所以你走吧

258
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,288
不要停下

259
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:02,057
去殿下那儿 将军

260
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,833
Go, General.

261
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:09,433
I'm all right.

262
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,023
I...

263
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:15,933
Your Highness, I...

264
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,233
I know.

265
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,523
I know everything.

266
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:26,833
And if this is the end for me,
then such is my fate.

267
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,048
这是谋反

268
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,952
满门抄斩 一个不留 这是御命

269
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,023
So please, go.

270
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,933
Don't stop, and keep
walking toward the king.

271
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:55,957


272
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,733
Don't spare her
or anyone related to her!

273
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,233
This is my command!

274
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,333
住手

275
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,908
还愣着干什么 让罪人跪下

276
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,286
将军

277
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:44,993
殿下 您这是为何

278
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:47,763
就不怕天谴吗

279
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,266
老天什么时候站在你们那边了

280
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,623
Stop!

281
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:55,237
罪人凶狠的眼神令御心慌乱

282
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,833
What are you doing?
Bring the criminal to his knees!

283
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,173
斩立决

284
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,984
这不关你事

285
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,023
General!

286
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:12,721
将军 将军 将军 将军

287
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,333
Your Highness!
How could you do this?

288
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:20,796
我想拜托你来结束我的性命

289
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,833
Have you no fear of the heavens?

290
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,023
It's not like the heavens
have ever taken your side.

291
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,733
Having that sinner's gaze
upon us is making me dizzy.

292
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,523
Strike him down now!

293
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,582
遵将军之命

294
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,733
This doesn't concern you.

295
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,933
General! General!

296
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:52,523
I want to make
a final request of you.

297
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,128
请您原谅

298
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:58,500
小的随后就来

299
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,333
To think that such a day would come.

300
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,892
任何人都不许替逆贼收尸

301
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,523
Forgive me, sir.

302
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:28,397
弃尸荒野任由猛禽野兽啃食

303
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,523
I'll be right behind you, sir.

304
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:35,437
他也就值给禽兽果腹

305
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,607
这是御命

306
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,823
Nobody may retrieve
this criminal's body.

307
00:16:55,823 --> 00:17:00,733
Leave it out on the fields to be
consumed by wild animals!

308
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:07,523
Such is the only fitting punishment
for a criminal such as him.

309
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,433
This is a royal decree!

310
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,624
将军 一路走好

311
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,325
将军

312
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,328
我们的将军

313
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,665
好可怜

314
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,769
我们的将军好可怜...

315
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,777
将军...

316
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:59,021
不要求任何人

317
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:04,523
- Please have mercy, God!
- Please, spare him!

318
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:03,092
神不会听的

319
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:09,598
一日之中阳光最明媚的午时

320
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:16,138
他死于自己保护的主君的刀下

321
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:31,023
<i>Don't pray to anyone or anything.</i>

322
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,523
<i>Because the gods aren't listening.</i>

323
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:42,323
<i>And on that clear,
sunny afternoon...</i>

324
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,523
<i>he died by the very
blade that he'd wielded.</i>

325
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:27,323
<i>[GOBLIN: THE LONELY AND GREAT GOD]</i>

326
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:41,733
<i>[SEOUL, 1998]</i>

327
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,229
这种疯子

328
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,565
长眼睛来喘气的吗

329
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,600
找死...

330
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,737
你这小子

331
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,073
是什么东西

332
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,046
野猪

333
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:08,751
什么

334
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:16,291
你撞到了野猪

335
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,523
Ow, damn it!
You crazy bastard!

336
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,823
Are your eyes only there
for decoration?

337
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,933
You have a death... wish...

338
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,433
Hey, what's with you, bastard?

339
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,275
你没事吧

340
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,877
要不要帮你报警

341
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,523
A wild boar.

342
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,548
我撞到了野猪

343
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,823
What?

344
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:40,883
就是说...

345
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,918
野猪突然间窜出来

346
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:45,721
野...野猪 在江南正中心

347
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,523
You struck a wild boar
with your car.

348
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:51,026
那...那里

349
00:20:49,547 --> 00:21:01,547


350
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:55,631
喂 是119吧

351
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,533
这里是驿三十字路口

352
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,935
后备箱里有个女人好像已经死了

353
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,304
不知道 现在一动不动

354
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:03,839
具体情况不知道

355
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,933
Are you all right, sir?
Do you want me to call the authorities?

356
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,774
究竟是因为交通事故 还是...

357
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,744
具体的不知道 请快点来看看

358
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:10,353
I just hit a wild boar, you see...

359
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,379
我怎么...

360
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,073
so, um, a wild boar
came out of nowhere!

361
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,816
-这里是驿三十字路口人行道
-我怎么会在那里

362
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:16,385
黄美英 25岁

363
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,873
A wild boar?
In the middle of Gangnam?

364
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:20,155
癸丑年 丁巳月 乙巳日 辰时出生

365
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:25,194
戊寅年 乙卯月 己卯日 八时三十二分死亡

366
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,873
It's... it's a person!

367
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,673
Oh my gosh, what do we do?

368
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,573
Hello? This is 911, right?

369
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,397
死因 窒息致死

370
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,373
I'm at the Yeoksang
four-way intersection.

371
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:31,073
There's a woman in the trunk of
a car here! I think she may be dead.

372
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,173
I'm not sure.
She's not moving. Yes.

373
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,503
是你本人吧

374
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,673
I'm not sure about that. I just happened
to come across this car accident...

375
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,373
I'm not sure what's going on.
You should hurry and come.

376
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,373
Yes.

377
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,273
Why am I...
why am I there?

378
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,353
Hwang Mi Young.
25 years old.

379
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:51,073
Born in the year of the ox
on March 1st.

380
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:55,873
Time of death is 08:32 on Friday.

381
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,173
That's the information
I have on the deceased.

382
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,095
喝吧 会让你忘掉今生的记忆

383
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,573
That's you, right?

384
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:14,643
如果不喝

385
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:17,913
会怎样

386
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:20,783
会后悔没有喝下去

387
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:22,184
不管是什么样的后悔

388
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:24,553
愿你都能留在今生

389
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:31,273
Drink it. It'll make you forget about
what happened to you in this life.

390
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:48,873
What happens if I don't drink this?

391
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,473
You'll come to regret it.

392
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:55,373
I hope that you will leave your
regrets behind with this life.

393
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,044
鬼怪

394
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:24,213
地狱使者

395
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,673
A goblin?

396
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,673
A god of death?

397
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,373
That's quite a vulgar
disguise he has on.

398
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:57,573
Your Lordship!

399
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,073
It's been 20 years
since I've last seen you.

400
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,673
Have you been well for
all those years, sir?

401
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,573
Have you been well?

402
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,973
Well, I've aged quite a bit, sir.

403
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:21,073
But you're looking
as brilliant as ever.

404
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,673
He doesn't look that cool to me.

405
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,873
You punk!

406
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,873
This is my grandson.
The one that I've told you about.

407
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:33,373
Greet him properly.

408
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,073
Who is this guy?

409
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:38,173
So you're Duk Hwa.

410
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:43,873
I'm someone who'll be your uncle, your
brother, your son, then your grandson.

411
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,873
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

412
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,373
What does that even mean?

413
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,573
You seem weirder and weirder
by the minute, Mister.

414
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,173
You brat!

415
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:57,473
Oh, I offer my deepest apologies, sir.

416
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,573
He's an only child
and was quite spoiled, you see.

417
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,173
But you...

418
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,973
Me? What about me?

419
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:14,973
There was a boy who was born in this land
but was laid to rest in another country.

420
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,473
You're his descendant.

421
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,173
And you look just like him.

422
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,773
Which part, exactly?

423
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,873
Was that ancestor of mine handsome?

424
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,773
Duk Hwa!

425
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:31,873
I have no idea how such an insolent child
came to be. My apologies, Your Lordship.

426
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:36,373
Worry not.
You've never disappointed anyone.

427
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:37,473
But you know, Uncle.

428
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,973
Why do you keep using
informal speech toward Grandpa?

429
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,173
Do you have a death wish
or something?

430
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,173
Why, you little!

431
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,673
Oh my...

432
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,973
<i>Your Lordship.</i>

433
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:57,873
I offer my deepest apologies
for coming to see you so late.

434
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:03,973
I've been sick all this
time, Your Lordship.

435
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:13,773
I must feel the same way
that your blade does, sir.

436
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:22,373
From this moment on, this child
will serve you, Your Lordship.

437
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,873
This is my grandson.

438
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:29,373
This sword is "Your Lordship," Grandpa?

439
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,973
<i>It seems that your subjects
have saved your soul.</i>

440
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:51,573
<i>However, your blade
is stained with blood.</i>

441
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:58,673
<i>They may have been your enemies,
but they were the gods' creations.</i>

442
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:04,973
<i>So you will be immortal and alone,
watching your loved ones die before you.</i>

443
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:08,173
<i>Not a single one of those deaths
will be wiped from your memory.</i>

444
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:15,073
<i>This blessing is the punishment
that I am giving to you.</i>

445
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:25,673
<i>And only the Goblin's Bride will be
able to remove that blade.</i>

446
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:31,073
<i>And when she does, you'll be able to
return to nothingness and rest in peace.</i>

447
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,773
Your Lordship!

448
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:43,173
There is a place
where I must go.

449
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,573
Who goes there?

450
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,473
How dare you come into
a place like this?

451
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,473
Hey, you insolent...

452
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,573
Y-you... are...

453
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:48,073
I was too late, it seems.

454
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,173
Grandpa! Grandpa!

455
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:06,173
Grandpa!

456
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:26,173
It seems...

457
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,373
that this is the first punishment
that I am receiving.

458
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:38,573
Please... accept me.

459
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,773
As of this moment,
I will serve you.

460
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,873
That was my grandfather's final wish.

461
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,173
I became blinded
by my desire for revenge...

462
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:08,673
and couldn't even ask your
grandfather how he'd been.

463
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,173
And yet...

464
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,073
you wish to serve me?

465
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:58,097


466
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:03,133
It's quite nice to be able to enjoy
a view like this at my leisure.

467
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,323
And I'm happy that you can enjoy
a view like this at your leisure.

468
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,823
Here.

469
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:36,323
You should have it, Your Lordship.
I'm still quite full.

470
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,523
How is it that you're full
when you've had nothing to eat?

471
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,133
I'm tiny, so I get full even after
eating the tiniest morsel of food.

472
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,323
You're much bigger than I am, sir,
so please eat that instead.

473
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:51,523
We can do this, then.

474
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,933
We're still quite
far from land, sir.

475
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,823
Neither of us will be full
if we share this.

476
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,783
So is that why
you're insisting on starving?

477
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:05,433
I'm a child, so I can go around
to beg for food if I get hungry.

478
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:09,293
Do you think I brought you with me
just to have you go around begging?

479
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,933
Trust me.

480
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:14,723
I may be an even greater
person than you imagine.

481
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,223
Come, now.

482
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,933
Wow!

483
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:40,723
Wow!

484
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:54,223
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!

485
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,723
Can I peek in that bag of yours?

486
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,923
We need to decrease
the weight on this boat, you see.

487
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,133
Your Lordship.
Your Lordship!

488
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,923
Put that child down now.

489
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,223
If you do, I'll let you keep
your life at the very least.

490
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:13,223
It's clear there's someone among us who's
at fault for the waves being unruly.

491
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,423
I'll sell you as a slave,
so give me your hands and feet!

492
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,923
And as for this squirt,
throw him overboard.

493
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,923
Do you know what happens to
humans who are lesser than animals?

494
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,423
They meet the God of Wrath.

495
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,423
H-h-he's a goblin!

496
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,023
Please, spare us!

497
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:26,923
It's too late.

498
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,323
It sure is nice to be back
here at my leisure.

499
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,923
Why? Why did you do that?

500
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,623
<i>If there is a god, please...</i>

501
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,523
<i>please, save me.</i>

502
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,233
<i>Please, save me.</i>

503
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,733
<i>Just anybody, please. Save me!</i>

504
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,623
Who are you?

505
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,123
I'm "just anybody."

506
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:42,233
Please... please, help me.

507
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,423
Well, I don't know.

508
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,323
It's my rule not to get involved
in human beings' lives.

509
00:39:55,323 --> 00:40:01,733
I... really can't
just die like this.

510
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:09,233
The one you're asking me
to save isn't you, is it?

511
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,823
Just my child, at least. Please.

512
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:46,623
You're lucky, though, to have
met a soft-hearted god like me.

513
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:50,923
It's just that I don't want
to see anyone die tonight.

514
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,033
<i>[JI YEON HEE. 27 YEARS OLD. BORN IN
THE YEAR OF THE TIGER ON MARCH 1ST.]</i>

515
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:03,643
<i>[NO NAME. ZERO YEARS OLD.]</i>

516
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,923
Snow, and rain, and...

517
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,423
flowers, eh?

518
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>- The Goblin's Bride is back.

<i>[EIGHT YEARS LATER]</i>

520
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:22,733
What do you want for your
birthday this year, Eun Tak?

521
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,623
Round rice cakes?
Square rice cakes?

522
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:30,623
Mom. Can't I have a party now
instead of Korean-style parties?

523
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,923
What's the difference?

524
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,323
Well, a cake instead of
rice cakes, for one.

525
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,923
I want to blow out candles
and make a wish too.

526
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,733
I think the reason why my
wish isn't coming true is because

527
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,423
I've been making my wishes on rice
cakes instead of birthday candles.

528
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,733
Oh, I didn't realize!

529
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,123
I only got you rice cakes
because you like them!

530
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,233
All right, then. Let's throw you
a party with cake from now on.

531
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,923
Wow! You're the best, Mom!

532
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:55,923
Oh, it's a puppy!

533
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:57,023
Huh? A puppy?

534
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,233
Look at this.
It's spring again.

535
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,923
Isn't that fascinating?

536
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:27,947


537
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:29,923
Ah, I'm so tired.

538
00:44:29,923 --> 00:44:32,623
Mom, I got a 100 on
my English quiz today!

539
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,733
I'm super-duper tired because
I used so much brainpower today!

540
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,123
Oh, really?

541
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,623
Wow! It's cake!

542
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:43,233
Are we going to have
a party now, Mom?

543
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:47,623
Yeah. Come and sit.
Light the candles.

544
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,423
Is it okay for me to light them?

545
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,923
You can do it since you're
all grown up now, Eun Tak.

546
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,523
Oh yeah.
I'm nine years old now.

547
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:59,123
I even got a 100 on my English
quiz, so this is a cakewalk.

548
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:01,323
Where did you learn that saying?

549
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,123
You don't need to know, Mom.

550
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:07,233
I'm just good at picking up these
things from all sorts of people.

551
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:10,423
I think I might be a genius...

552
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:16,023
What's the matter?
You have to make a wish.

553
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,323
Happy birthday, my little pup!

554
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,023
It's not really you, Mom.

555
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:29,123
It's your spirit that
I'm talking to, isn't it?

556
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:37,123
So... you really can see
everything, can't you?

557
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:42,323
I was hoping that you
wouldn't be able to.

558
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,233
Are you dead, Mom?

559
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:55,023
Really?

560
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,923
Where are you, Mom?
Where are you now?

561
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:07,623
At Sageori Hospital.

562
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:20,733
You'll be getting
a call from the hospital.

563
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,523
And when you get there,
your aunt will arrive soon.

564
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:27,023
It's cold at night, so make
sure you have a scarf on.

565
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:30,123
Ask the granny at the supermarket
to go with you too. Okay?

566
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,323
You know how to get to
her place, right?

567
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:38,323
Go down the alleyway next to
the dry cleaners and then make a right.

568
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:40,623
Oh, you're so clever,
my little pup!

569
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:48,423
Don't ever look another spirit
in the eye from now on, okay?

570
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:53,623
I'm sorry, Mom, that I can see spirits.

571
00:46:55,023 --> 00:47:01,523
But it's because I can see spirits
that I can see you now.

572
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,733
I'm okay, Mom.

573
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,243
Okay.

574
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,523
Thank you so much...

575
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,623
for seeing me like this.

576
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:27,523
I... I think that
I have to go now.

577
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,523
I love you, my little pup.

578
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:39,823
Me too.
I love you too, Mom.

579
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:43,823
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

580
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:48,823
You have to go to heaven, okay?

581
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,533
You have to!

582
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,823
Mom!

583
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,133
Mom!

584
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,533
<i>Hello? Is this
Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home?</i>

585
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,723
<i>This is Sageori Jaeil
Hospital, and...</i>

586
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:36,823
I know.
I'll head over there.

587
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,923
I'm not going to make a wish.

588
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,323
I'm not going to make
even a single wish.

589
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,323
Nobody ever grants
them for me anyway.

590
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,133
So who would I even
make the wish to?

591
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:34,923
How is it that you never
seem to grow old, Granny?

592
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:38,533
How could I possibly get
any older than this?

593
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,923
You do have a point.

594
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:51,633
Can't you check up on my Eun Tak
every once in a while?

595
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,133
Spouting such nonsense again.

596
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,133
Why would I check up
on your daughter?

597
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,923
Just every once in a while!

598
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,633
Give her some leftover
cabbage if you have any

599
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,633
and some spinach, too.

600
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,423
You should've just died then. Why did you
have to ask them to give you more time?

601
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,903
You're so mean.

602
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,533
You're the one who told me
to plead with them with all my heart.

603
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,823
And you actually believed that?

604
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,323
And thanks to that, I got to live
for a bit longer before I had to go.

605
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,633
Thanks for everything, Granny.

606
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,423
I came to say goodbye.

607
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:40,423
I'm... going now.

608
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:10,447


609
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,533
Who are you, Mister?

610
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:24,823
You... can see me?

611
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,323
Oh, my scarf. I didn't put it on.
Mom's going to yell at me.

612
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,223
You have it on already, though.

613
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,423
This is Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home, right?

614
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:38,823
I came here since her spirit
wasn't at the hospital.

615
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:44,633
But how is a child like you, who wasn't
supposed to have been born...

616
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:50,863
??

617
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,533
Did you, by any chance,
become nine years old this year?

618
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,633
I can't hear your voice
at all, Mister.

619
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:04,223
What brings you here, ma'am?

620
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,533
Go. And leave this child alone.

621
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:09,923
Granny!

622
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:17,223
You're getting in the way of my work.

623
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:19,133
As if.

624
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,923
Why are you trying to take her now
when it's already been so long?

625
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:23,133
I'm glad for this chance.
Better late than never.

626
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:24,723
I have no time right now.

627
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,533
That's your problem.

628
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,723
Do you have this child's
name on your list?

629
00:52:28,723 --> 00:52:32,533
She had no name back then,
but she has a name now.

630
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:36,133
If you have a certificate with
her name on it, hand it over.

631
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,723
I'll hand her over if you do.

632
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:41,823
If I'm going to get that, I need to get
nine years' worth of evidence on her.

633
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:43,633
You, of all people, should know...

634
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:57,033
I'll be seeing you again, child.

635
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:06,033
Granny! Mom is...

636
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:08,923
I know. And we can't
do anything about that.

637
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,133
But you have to live.

638
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:14,323
You have to move within three days
if you don't want him to find you.

639
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:18,923
You've looked a God of Death in the
eye, so you can't live here any longer.

640
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:21,723
He won't be able to
find me if I move?

641
00:53:21,723 --> 00:53:23,423
No, he won't.

642
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:25,633
That's why land is so important.

643
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:34,823
After midnight, a man and two women
will come for you at the funeral parlor.

644
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:36,723
Go with them.

645
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:44,823
It'll be hard on you,
but you have no other choice.

646
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,923
But why are you telling
me all of this?

647
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,133
Because I've taken a liking to you.

648
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,423
When she was pregnant with you...

649
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,533
she was so happy.

650
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:07,423
Here. A birthday gift.

651
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,133
<i>[10 YEARS LATER]</i>

652
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,133
Excuse me.

653
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:22,323
Want to get a drink with me?

654
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,323
Sure.

655
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:32,723
<i>This card worked up until
yesterday, but now it doesn't!</i>

656
00:55:32,723 --> 00:55:34,423
<i>So, um, Uncle.</i>

657
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,633
<i>There are some unfriendly
guys in suits at the bar.</i>

658
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:42,133
<i>I'm, um, with those people right now.</i>

659
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,423
<i>So please, pick up the phone!</i>

660
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,423
<i>They asked for your cell phone number</i>

661
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:49,823
<i>and got really unfriendly when
I told them that you don't have one.</i>

662
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,823
<i>Uncle. Are you listening?</i>

663
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:57,133
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

664
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,533
<i>Uncle!</i>

665
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,723
She still eats by herself even
though it's the end of senior year.

666
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,133
If you feel that bad for her,
go and eat with her yourself.

667
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,923
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

668
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:12,633
That girl sees spirits!

669
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,323
I'm more scared of her
than I am of ghosts.

670
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:16,723
At least you can't see ghosts.

671
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:21,533
Look. She can hear everything we're
saying, but she's acting as if she can't.

672
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,923
Hey.

673
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:41,033
Hey, I heard that
you're the Goblin's Bride.

674
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:44,533
Come on, I know you can see me.

675
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,323
Come with me.
It's just that I'm so lonely!

676
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:49,323
Please?

677
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,533
Hey, why do you keep ignoring me?

678
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:56,133
You evil girl!

679
00:56:57,223 --> 00:56:58,923
Oh, geez!

680
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:02,133
See? I knew you could see me.

681
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:11,923
Wait, so it's true?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

682
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:17,823
What was that? Why did she
apologize all of the sudden?

683
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:13,223
You didn't even turn on
any of the lights, Your Lordship.

684
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:16,483
I was lost in my thoughts.

685
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:22,123
These are the materials you
requested of me from the NIS.

686
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:30,303
Then...

687
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,723
Yes. It's happened, Your Lordship.

688
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:39,323
Duk Hwa is already 25 years old now.

689
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:44,723
I've pulled a lot of strings so you can
leave near the end of the month.

690
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,723
If you leave now, Your Lordship...

691
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,623
this will be the last time in
my lifetime I'll see you, correct?

692
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:09,533
I thank you for every second
that we've shared together.

693
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,823
Duk Hwa will be here
when you return, sir.

694
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:25,083
I've been losing my keys
all the time lately

695
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,593
so I've had the lock
changed to a keyless one.

696
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,023
Grandpa! Uncle Shin!

697
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:37,383
There you are, Uncle Shin.
I begged you to come and pick me up.

698
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:39,293
But here you are.

699
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,043
Do not interrupt an adults' conversation!

700
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,523
Did you cancel my card?

701
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,573
You canceled my card, didn't you!

702
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:49,333
Yeah, I canceled it, you brat.

703
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:52,813
Ugh, I was totally humiliated!
Do you know how tough she was to get to?

704
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,143
Why did you even make me your heir
if you were going to treat me like this?

705
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,193
Uncle Shin, are you going somewhere?

706
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:06,913
- Where are you going?
- I told you to speak with more respect!

707
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,223
Stay out of this, Grandpa.

708
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:12,533
Is it about that thing again?
About you looking for your bride?

709
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:15,833
Why can't you just say that you're
leaving to get married somewhere?

710
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,833
Why can't you say it!

711
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,453
You're saying this kid will be here
when I return?

712
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:26,443
Uncle Shin, exactly when
and what time are you leaving?

713
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:10,467


714
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,713
One male and two females!
Your breakfast is ready.

715
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:19,613
I said, your breakfast is ready.

716
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:23,503
Shut up, you loudmouth.

717
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:26,803
Why are you blabbering so much over
the stupid breakfast you cooked?

718
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,233
What's with the seaweed soup?
Is it someone's birthday today?

719
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,723
Are you kidding me? Did she make the soup
because it's her birthday or something?

720
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,263
Yeah, it is.

721
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:40,243
How can she be proud of having killed her
own mom just to be born on this day?

722
01:02:40,243 --> 01:02:42,463
She's shameless because
she doesn't know any better.

723
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,883
Whatever she learned, she got it from you
since she's been with us for 10 years.

724
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,563
Shut up and eat your food.

725
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:51,083
Thanks for wishing me a happy birthday.

726
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:56,263
This is why people say that
you should never take in a stray.

727
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:58,023
Being too compassionate is my downfall.

728
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:02,073
I'm the pitiful one here since
I've raised her in her mother's stead.

729
01:03:02,073 --> 01:03:04,603
Your words are a bit harsh.

730
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,433
How is it harsh?

731
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,413
She may be your mom,
but she's my older sister.

732
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:11,563
Exactly. She and I are closer in
both heart and connection.

733
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:15,093
- Do you even know what you're saying?
- Shut up and eat your food.

734
01:03:15,093 --> 01:03:17,483
Where are you running off to?

735
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:20,283
I'm not running off anywhere.
I'm going to school.

736
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:30,053
You're dead if you touch those umbrellas.

737
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,513
Meet me at the bank
with your bankbook after school.

738
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:34,593
You know what will happen
if you don't, right?

739
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:38,223
How many times have I told you
that I don't have a bankbook?

740
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:47,443
Then where's the bankbook?
Where's your mom's insurance money?

741
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,993
How would I know that?

742
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:58,673
You took all the money for yourself!
You even took the money from our house!

743
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:02,693
Why is she talking
so much crap this morning?

744
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:05,623
Just shut up and bring it
unless you want to get your ass beaten.

745
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:07,933
The bankbook disappears whenever
I need to go to the bank

746
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,163
and who else could it be but you?

747
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,813
I'm telling you that
the bitch is possessed.

748
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:15,233
That's right.
There's a ghost right behind you.

749
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,793
What! You crazy bitch!

750
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:29,773
<i>My lordship.</i>

751
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:34,173
Will you be traveling alone
this time too?

752
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,523
Yes, it would seem so.

753
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:41,283
No women I've ever met has been
able to see the sword.

754
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,613
Which is of a great relief to me.

755
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:50,643
I hope the bride appears quickly for you
when you're in agony over the sword.

756
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:55,323
But if the sword is seen,
I hope no one finds out about it.

757
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:59,493
That's just human greed, I guess.

758
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:03,973
It's a relief for me too.

759
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:09,733
To still have you by my side,
and a full drink in my hand besides.

760
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:13,313
For tonight at least,
I'd like to remain alive.

761
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,633
Shall we drink to that?

762
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:54,053
When I was nine years old,
I told myself that I'd never do this.

763
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,333
But I'm desperate right now,
so I hope you understand.

764
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,883
Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives

765
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:06,083
and please help me find a boyfriend!

766
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,063
<i>Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives</i>

767
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,843
and help me improve my pathetic life.

768
01:07:16,843 --> 01:07:18,883
Even 100 won in my pocket
would be fine! Please.

769
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,863
What in the world am I doing?

770
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:28,033
Who am I even praying to?

771
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,493
There is no god.

772
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:47,113
You're seriously not going to
make it rain right now, are you?

773
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:50,673
It's not even the rainy season!

774
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:53,473
Will the rain even stop?
Will it ever?

775
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:58,993
Why do you keep making it rain when
I don't even have an umbrella of my own?

776
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:03,733
- Was it you?
- Oh my goodness.

777
01:08:07,073 --> 01:08:08,943
Me?

778
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:17,863
Me?

779
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,913
- Were you talking to me?
- Yeah, you.

780
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:23,913
Was it you?

781
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,623
- What about me?
- Were you the one who summoned me?

782
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:30,283
- Me? I didn't summon you.
- You did summon me.

783
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:33,423
- But just how did you summon me?
- How would I have summoned you?

784
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:37,003
- I seriously didn't summon you.
- You definitely did summon me.

785
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:40,563
- Try to remember how you summoned me.
- Desperately?

786
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:46,983
I didn't summon you.
I'm just able to see you.

787
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:50,593
Because we accidentally locked eyes
when we passed each other the other day.

788
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:53,213
You're him, aren't you?

789
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:57,013
- What do you mean, you can see me?
- You're a ghost, aren't you?

790
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:59,483
I'm able to see ghosts.

791
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:02,563
- I'm not a ghost.
- That's what they all say at first.

792
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:07,663
Who are you?

793
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,333
Why can't you see what you
should see right in front of you?

794
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:14,123
- What am I supposed to see?
- Your twenties, thirties... your future.

795
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:17,113
Maybe because there is no future for me.

796
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:23,353
Were you a shaman or something
before you died? Or a con man?

797
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:27,613
- My future, my butt.
- What? A con, what?

798
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:31,743
Go to the light.
Wandering around for too long isn't good.

799
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:37,923
- What's with those flowers?
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

800
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,563
Okay, leave.

801
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:41,633
They're buckwheat flowers.

802
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:46,433
But that's not what I'm asking.
Why are you holding those flowers?

803
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:49,663
Give them to me.
They don't really suit you.

804
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,713
I've never been told that before.
I've seriously never been told that.

805
01:09:55,293 --> 01:09:57,483
You can just give them to me.

806
01:09:57,483 --> 01:10:00,223
It's my birthday today.

807
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,393
A very depressing birthday.

808
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:19,233
I get nothing but weeds for my birthday.

809
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:22,433
I got a napa cabbage
for my ninth birthday.

810
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:27,863
But what is the meaning
of these buckwheat flowers?

811
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:29,823
Lovers.

812
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:52,847


813
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:57,233
Why were you crying?

814
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,593
Job, relatives, or boyfriend?
Which of the three were you crying over?

815
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,343
- How did you know that?
- I heard you.

816
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,463
What do you mean, you heard it?

817
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,803
- I grant some people their wishes.
- You grant people their wishes?

818
01:11:13,593 --> 01:11:17,773
Like a magic genie?
Or a guardian angel?

819
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:21,243
Are you serious?
I knew it.

820
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:25,493
I knew you were different from other
ghosts from the moment I first saw you.

821
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:28,673
- Are you really my guardian angel?
- I didn't say I was your guardian angel.

822
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:33,773
My mom once told me that everyone is born
with their own life dictionary.

823
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:41,553
And in my dictionary, words such as
"Luck" or "Fortune" don't exist.

824
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:47,393
- You know what I mean, right?
- No, I don't.

825
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,203
I'm asking if I can have
about five million.

826
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:56,073
If getting me the cash is too tough,
then tell me the winning lottery numbers.

827
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:59,643
Go and say goodbye to your family.
You won't get to see them for a while.

828
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,813
Keep looking for a job at a chicken
restaurant. You'll find something soon.

829
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:11,903
Hey! What about my boyfriend?

830
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:14,973
Hello? Hey!

831
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:18,033
Ugh, what a poor sport!

832
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:35,133
- I haven't met you before.
- Likewise.

833
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,473
But I have heard rumors.

834
01:12:37,473 --> 01:12:40,313
There are all sorts of rumors about me.

835
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,403
What are you doing in my home?

836
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:43,773
You live here?

837
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:47,523
All the furniture you see is included,
so you just need to move in...

838
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,503
When did you get home, Uncle Shin?

839
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,583
- Explain.
- The thing is...

840
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,693
this house is going to sit vacant
for like 20 years.

841
01:12:56,693 --> 01:13:02,543
I thought about the money we could make
by charging someone monthly rent...

842
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:05,073
Do you even know what that is?
That thing over there is...

843
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:07,243
Don't refer to our new tenant as "that"!

844
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,983
He owns tea houses.

845
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:13,693
I'm sorry, I apologize.
My uncle is socially awkward.

846
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:15,633
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

847
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:22,653
- He hasn't paid yet.
- I saw the new car out front.

848
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,143
- It's the new tenant's car.
- It's not my car.
