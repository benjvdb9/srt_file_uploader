00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,500
<i>若靈魂附在某人的舊物</i>

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>或沾了血的物件上</i>

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,240
<i>便會成為鬼怪</i>

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,820
<i>上過無數戰場 染過鮮血的長劍</i>

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,450
<i>沾染上了主人的血更甚</i>

9
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:02,633
<i>If a spirit inhabits an object that has
the touch or the blood of a human on it</i>

10
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,933
<i>the spirit becomes a goblin.</i>

11
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,910
<i>唯有鬼怪的新娘 才可拔出此劍</i>

12
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>拔出劍之後 一切歸於無 便可安息</i>

13
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,933
<i>And this was a sword
from a battlefield</i>

14
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,843
<i>with the blood of thousands on it</i>

15
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,023
<i>with even its own owner's blood on
it, so it was only to be expected.</i>

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,230
<i>這是惡毒的神諭</i>

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>而以不死之身重生的鬼怪</i>

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>在這世上亦有亦無</i>

19
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>And only the bride of the goblin will
be able to pull out that sword.</i>

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,500
<i>此刻也在某...</i>

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,840
笑什麼 死丫頭

22
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,503
<i>And when the sword is pulled out</i>

23
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:48,323
<i>he will become nothing
once more, and rest in peace.</i>

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,350
此刻 也可能在某處尋找著新娘

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,120
<b>-=第1集=-</b>

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,080
而那個新娘... 就是我

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,650
你是想這麼說的嗎

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,150
別看我現在這樣

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,920
年輕時可是俘獲了不少男人的心

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,460
下次來時若我不在了 你可別吃驚

31
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,323
Of course, this is a cruel
deal for the goblin.

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,460
真是羨慕啊

33
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,823
The goblin, which woke up
to realize that it is immortal

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,460
我真是老糊塗了

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,600
跟你這個未婚媽媽炫耀這些

36
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,533
is everywhere and nowhere in
this world at the same time

37
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,423
and even now, nobody
knows where he may be...

38
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,800
真壞

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,770
菠菜 白菜都給你算便宜了

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,940
我還壞

41
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,633
Why the hell are you laughing, girl?

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,410
是拋棄你的那個混蛋才是壞

43
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:23,423
Are you about to tell me, "He's still
looking for his bride, and it's me"?

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,050
那倒是

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,520
不過這個故事好傷感

46
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,423
Even though I look like this now, I had
hordes of men following me in my prime!

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,290
有何傷感的

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,050
是一個浪漫而怨毒的詛咒

49
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:32,423
Don't come back next time
only to be surprised to find me gone.

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,790
為求死而尋找新娘

51
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,923
Wow, I'm so jealous.

52
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,960
神真壞

53
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,423
I'm just getting old.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,460
神原本就不是好惹的

55
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,233
That's not something for me to
brag about in front of you, though.

56
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,600
自私 善妒

57
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,823
Hey, that's not nice!

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,940
唯我獨尊

59
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:47,533
No, I'm not! I give you discounts
on spinach and cabbage!

60
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,440
和某人真像

61
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,033
The bastard who left you behind
and ran off is the not nice one here.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,240
我走了 祝您生意興隆

63
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,733
You do have a point.

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,950
下次來 您也一定要在哦

65
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,033
But you know, that story is too sad.

66
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,323
Ha, sure.

67
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:03,123
It's really a romantic sort of curse.

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,920
危在旦夕時

69
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,923
I mean, he has to find
his bride in order to die.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,360
你要虔誠禱告

71
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,133
God is cruel.

72
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,423
God has always been cruel.

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,200
<i>-=1968年巴黎=-</i>

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
可能某位好心的神

75
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,533
And he's selfish and jealous too.

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,670
會聽到你的禱告

77
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,533
God only cares about himself.

78
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,133
He's just like another
guy we know, huh?

79
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,133
Well, I'll be going now.
I hope you sell a lot.

80
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,233
And you'd better be
here next time too, okay?

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
換做是我 不會這麼做

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,650
你若現在離開家

83
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,033
When you're in a position in which
your life is flashing before your eyes

84
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,890
就會過上比現在更糟糕的生活

85
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,290
可能會再也見不到你媽媽

86
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,923
pray for mercy
with all your heart.

87
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,620
你是誰

88
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,420
韓國人嗎

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,130
一言難盡

90
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:45,733
<i>Because a god with a soft spot
may be listening to you.</i>

91
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,960
現在該你了

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,430
逐字逐句地說清楚

93
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,323
<i>[PARIS, 1968]</i>

94
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,170
告訴他 既然領養了我

95
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,800
你就是我的父親

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,570
所以 你該好好撫養我

97
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,240
去告訴你媽媽 讓她幫你

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,940
告訴她你的痛苦

99
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,310
你在胡說八道什麼

100
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,070
讓開

101
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,510
提醒你一句 那樣割脈只能廢了手臂卻死不了

102
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,350
你是誰

103
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,350
看著他 逐字逐句地說

104
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,533
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

105
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,680
能做到嗎？

106
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,033
If you run away from home now, you'll
live with worse people than that.

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,420
要是被打死了怎麼辦

108
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,950
你負責嗎？

109
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,820
所以我先幫你弄斷了他的類肋骨

110
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,233
And you'll never see
your mother again.

111
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,123
Who the hell are you?
Are you Korean?

112
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,090
你個混蛋...

113
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,033
I'm a more complicated person
than you'd think.

114
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,733
It's your turn now.

115
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,333
Go and tell him clearly

116
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,733
"You've adopted me, so you're my father.
So you have to raise me well."

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,670
這是便當

118
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,800
等談完了上學去

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,170
第17道數學題答案不是2 而是4

120
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,833
And ask your mother for help too.
And tell her you're in pain.

121
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,400
那道題不能錯

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,910
你到底是誰

123
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,123
What kind of bull are you spouting?
Get the hell out of my way!

124
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,333
And slitting your wrist like
that won't kill you

125
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,833
but it'll render your hand
useless, so be aware of that.

126
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,333
Who are you?

127
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,123
Don't avoid his gaze
and speak clearly.

128
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,423
Can you do that?

129
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:41,233
And what if he beats me to death?
Will you take responsibility?

130
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,833
That's why I broke his rib for you.

131
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,733
You little bastard!

132
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,690
他是水 是火 是風

133
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,930
是光明 是黑暗

134
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,623
That's lunch for you.

135
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,070
也曾是...

136
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,833
Go to school
after you're done talking to him.

137
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,233
The answer for number 17
on the math quiz isn't 2. It's 4.

138
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,533
You got that question wrong, so...

139
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,833
Who... are you, really?

140
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,140
人類

141
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:20,923
<i>He's water, wind, and fire.</i>

142
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,623
<i>Light and darkness.</i>

143
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,833
<i>And at one time...</i>

144
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,340
百姓稱他為神

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,123
<i>he was human.</i>

146
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,650
闖過血雨腥風 殺敵無數

147
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,150
當得起武神二字

148
00:05:49,147 --> 00:06:01,147


149
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,033
<i>His subjects called him "God."</i>

150
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:17,123
<i>He cut down his foes
covered in crimson blood</i>.

151
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:22,123
<i>And he was a military man
through and through.</i>

152
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,450
金信將軍萬歲...

153
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,290
萬歲...

154
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,690
金信將軍萬歲...

155
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,000
將軍萬歲...

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,900
萬歲...

157
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,710
打開城門

158
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,510
金信將軍 凱旋

159
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,850
金信卸下戎裝

160
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:35,123
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,350
大膽 竟敢出言不遜

162
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,420
正七品別將竟敢對上將軍...

163
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:43,833
- Hooray for the general!
- Hooray for the general!

164
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,030
明君的叛臣金信 卸下戎裝

165
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,700
你竟敢...

166
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,600
好

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,770
等著

168
00:08:54,933 --> 00:09:00,433
Step aside! It's the great
General Kim Shin!

169
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,123
Kim Shin will take off his armor
and heed the king's royal decree.

170
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,180
可以了吧

171
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,880
逆臣金信

172
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,523
I dare you to say
that again, punk!

173
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,590
棄劍 跪下領旨

174
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:12,623
How dare some political
lackey like you oppose...

175
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,590
我非割下你的舌頭...

176
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,460
何來的逆臣 瘋了不成

177
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:16,123
The criminal Kim Shin will
take off his armor and...

178
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,530
失心瘋了嗎你們

179
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,623
How dare you!

180
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,023
I heard you loud and clear.
Wait there.

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,340
將軍

182
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,900
逆臣 金信

183
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,210
棄劍跪下...

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,750
本將軍要見殿下 讓開

185
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,733
Happy now?

186
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,680
罪臣金信...

187
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,733
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,420
擋我者死

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,420
讓開

190
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,933
and heed the king's royal decree.

191
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,333
I'll pull that rotten tongue
of yours right out!

192
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,733
"Criminal Kim Shin"?
Are you out of your damn mind?

193
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,123
Are you insane?

194
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,300
救命啊

195
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,623
General.

196
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:02,333
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees...

197
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,570
救命啊

198
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
你們這幫傢夥

199
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,123
I'm going to see the king.
Get out of my way.

200
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,580
我們以主君之名已戰了3天3夜

201
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,933
- Criminal Kim Shin...
- If you don't move, you'll surely die.

202
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,880
好不容易才從人間地獄活著回來

203
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,733
Step aside.

204
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,190
可是你們... 你們竟然...

205
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,160
打開城門

206
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,800
守在他們身邊

207
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,670
我去去就來

208
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,833
You bastards!

209
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,733
These men fought
for three straight nights!

210
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,523
They were just on their way
back from that hell!

211
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:49,123
So how dare you...
how dare you bastards!

212
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:52,333
Open the castle gates!

213
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,933
Stay here and watch over the men.

214
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,933
I'll be right back.

215
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,670
百姓之上是王

216
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,510
王之上是神

217
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,210
據說那神就是指金信

218
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,590
他打了無數勝仗 蠱惑了百姓

219
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,090
他的權勢再三嘲弄王室

220
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,730
請以國法嚴加懲處

221
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,500
他

222
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,000
雖能看清敵人的刀刃

223
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:42,333
They say that he's like a king among
the people and regarded as a god.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,310
但沒能看出年輕君王對自己的嫉妒和恐懼

225
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,833
And his name is Kim Shin.

226
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,350
那是 指向自己的最鋒利的刀刃

227
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,833
<i>That man's endless ascension to power
is making the citizens rise up</i>

228
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,650
可惜他沒能看清

229
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>and his power makes a mockery
of the royal family's authority.</i>

230
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,733
So please, issue him the harshest
punishment you can under the law.

231
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,830
真要做到如此地步嗎

232
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,600
所以不要再過來

233
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,523
<i>He was able to see the blades
of his opponents quite well</i>

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,100
停下

235
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
不管你有什麼理由 都停下

236
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>but he'd been blind to the young
king's fear and jealousy toward him.</i>

237
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
停在那裡 死於逆賊之名吧

238
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,610
那麼除了你之外 可以放過所有人

239
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,810
但是 如果再往前走一步

240
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,523
<i>And he was unaware of the fact</i>

241
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,680
你每邁出一步 每一個眼神

242
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:28,833
<i>that the king's jealousy and fear were
sharper than any blade he'd known.</i>

243
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,350
我都會殺了所有人鋪在你的腳下

244
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,150
向前走吧 將軍

245
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,560
我沒關係

246
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,023
So he's really going this far?

247
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,833
Don't step any closer.

248
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,930
我...

249
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,123
Stop right there.

250
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,023
Stop all of it.

251
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,770
王妃娘娘 我...

252
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,470
我知道

253
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:48,733
Stop right there and die.
If you do, I'll spare everyone else.

254
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,670
我真的全都知道

255
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,833
But if you take even one
more step toward me

256
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,380
如果這就是我的結局

257
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,550
那麼這也是我的命運

258
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:56,933
I'll kill everyone in front of you
and lay their corpses at your feet.

259
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,780
所以你往前走吧

260
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,480
不要停下

261
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,250
去殿下那兒 將軍

262
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,833
Go, General.

263
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:09,433
I'm all right.

264
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,023
I...

265
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:15,933
Your Highness, I...

266
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,233
I know.

267
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,523
I know everything.

268
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:26,833
And if this is the end for me,
then such is my fate.

269
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,240
你這是謀反

270
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,150
滿門抄斬 一個不留 這是禦命

271
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,023
So please, go.

272
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,933
Don't stop, and keep
walking toward the king.

273
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:55,957


274
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,733
Don't spare her
or anyone related to her!

275
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,233
This is my command!

276
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,530
住手

277
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,100
還愣著幹什麼 讓罪人跪下

278
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,480
將軍

279
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,190
殿下 您這是為何

280
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,960
就不怕天譴嗎

281
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,460
老天什麼時候站在你們那邊了

282
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,623
Stop!

283
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,430
罪人兇狠的眼神令禦心慌亂

284
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,833
What are you doing?
Bring the criminal to his knees!

285
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,370
斬立決

286
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,180
這不關你事

287
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,023
General!

288
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,920
將軍 將軍 將軍 將軍

289
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,333
Your Highness!
How could you do this?

290
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,990
我想拜託你來結束我的性命

291
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,833
Have you no fear of the heavens?

292
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,023
It's not like the heavens
have ever taken your side.

293
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,733
Having that sinner's gaze
upon us is making me dizzy.

294
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,523
Strike him down now!

295
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,780
遵將軍之命

296
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,733
This doesn't concern you.

297
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,933
General! General!

298
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:52,523
I want to make
a final request of you.

299
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,320
請您原諒

300
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,700
小的隨後就來

301
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,333
To think that such a day would come.

302
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,090
任何人都不許替逆賊收屍

303
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,523
Forgive me, sir.

304
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,590
棄屍荒野任由猛禽野獸啃食

305
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,523
I'll be right behind you, sir.

306
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:35,630
他也就值給禽獸果腹

307
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,800
這是禦命

308
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,823
Nobody may retrieve
this criminal's body.

309
00:16:55,823 --> 00:17:00,733
Leave it out on the fields to be
consumed by wild animals!

310
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:07,523
Such is the only fitting punishment
for a criminal such as him.

311
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,433
This is a royal decree!

312
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,820
將軍 一路走好

313
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,520
將軍

314
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
我們的將軍

315
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,860
好可憐

316
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,960
我們的將軍好可憐...

317
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,970
將軍...

318
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,220
不要求任何人

319
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:04,523
- Please have mercy, God!
- Please, spare him!

320
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,290
神不會聽的

321
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,790
一日之中陽光最明媚的午時

322
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,330
他死於自己保護的主君的刀下

323
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:31,023
<i>Don't pray to anyone or anything.</i>

324
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,523
<i>Because the gods aren't listening.</i>

325
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:42,323
<i>And on that clear,
sunny afternoon...</i>

326
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,523
<i>he died by the very
blade that he'd wielded.</i>

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,940
<i>-=孤單又燦爛的神 - 鬼怪=-</i>

328
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,980
<i>-=1998年首爾=-</i>

00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:27,323

<i>[SEOUL, 1998]</i>

331
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,420
這種瘋子

332
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,760
長眼睛來喘氣的嗎

333
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,800
找死...

334
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,930
你這小子

335
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,270
是什麼東西

336
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,240
野豬

337
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,950
什麼

338
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,490
你撞到了野豬

339
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,523
Ow, damn it!
You crazy bastard!

340
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,823
Are your eyes only there
for decoration?

341
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,933
You have a death... wish...

342
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,433
Hey, what's with you, bastard?

343
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,470
你沒事吧

344
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,523
A wild boar.

345
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,070
要不要幫你報警

346
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,740
我撞到了野豬

347
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,823
What?

348
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,080
就是說...

349
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,110
野豬突然間竄出來

350
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,920
野...野豬 在江南市中心

351
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,523
You struck a wild boar
with your car.

352
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,220
那...那裡

353
00:20:49,547 --> 00:21:01,547


354
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,830
喂 是119吧

355
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,730
這裡是驛三十字路口

356
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,130
後備箱裡有個女人好像已經死了

357
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,500
不知道 現在一動不動

358
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,030
具體情況不知道

359
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,933
Are you all right, sir?
Do you want me to call the authorities?

360
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,970
究竟是因為交通事故 還是...

361
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,940
具體的不知道 請快點來看看

362
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:10,353
I just hit a wild boar, you see...

363
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,570
我怎麼...

364
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,073
so, um, a wild boar
came out of nowhere!

365
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,010
-這裡是驛三十字路口人行道
-我怎麼會在那裡

366
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,580
黃美英 25歲

367
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,873
A wild boar?
In the middle of Gangnam?

368
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,350
癸醜年 丁巳月 乙巳日 辰時出生

369
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,873
It's... it's a person!

370
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,390
戊寅年 乙卯月 己卯日 八時三十二分死亡

371
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,673
Oh my gosh, what do we do?

372
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,573
Hello? This is 911, right?

373
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,590
死因 窒息致死

374
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,373
I'm at the Yeoksang
four-way intersection.

375
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:31,073
There's a woman in the trunk of
a car here! I think she may be dead.

376
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,173
I'm not sure.
She's not moving. Yes.

377
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,700
是你本人吧

378
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,673
I'm not sure about that. I just happened
to come across this car accident...

379
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,373
I'm not sure what's going on.
You should hurry and come.

380
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,373
Yes.

381
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,273
Why am I...
why am I there?

382
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,353
Hwang Mi Young.
25 years old.

383
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:51,073
Born in the year of the ox
on March 1st.

384
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:55,873
Time of death is 08:32 on Friday.

385
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,173
That's the information
I have on the deceased.

386
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,290
喝吧 會讓你忘掉今生的記憶

387
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,573
That's you, right?

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,840
如果不喝

389
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,110
會怎樣

390
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,980
會後悔沒有喝下去

391
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,380
不管是什麼樣的後悔

392
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,750
願你都能留在今生

393
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:31,273
Drink it. It'll make you forget about
what happened to you in this life.

394
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:48,873
What happens if I don't drink this?

395
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,473
You'll come to regret it.

396
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:55,373
I hope that you will leave your
regrets behind with this life.

397
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,240
鬼怪

398
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,410
地獄使者

399
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,680
戴了一頂俗不可耐的帽子

400
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,673
A goblin?

401
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,673
A god of death?

402
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,373
That's quite a vulgar
disguise he has on.

403
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,700
老爺

404
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,450
二十年沒見了

405
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,920
您別來無恙吧

406
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,320
你也一切還安好吧

407
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,890
我可是老了很多

408
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,490
老爺依然那麼帥氣

409
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,800
沒感覺太帥啊

410
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,930
混小子

411
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:57,573
Your Lordship!

412
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,200
微臣鬥膽向您介紹 這是微臣的孫子

413
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,370
問候一聲吧

414
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,950
<i>-=劉德華=-</i>

415
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,240
這位大叔是誰啊

416
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,073
It's been 20 years
since I've last seen you.

417
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,180
你就是德華啊

418
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,350
我會是你的叔叔 你的兄弟

419
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,673
Have you been well for
all those years, sir?

420
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,020
繼而便將成為你的兒子 你的孫子

421
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,573
Have you been well?

422
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,973
Well, I've aged quite a bit, sir.

423
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,260
請多多關照咯

424
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:21,073
But you're looking
as brilliant as ever.

425
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,560
這什麼鬼

426
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,030
真是越來越奇怪了

427
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,660
混小子

428
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,673
He doesn't look that cool to me.

429
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,860
哎喲喂 微臣惶恐

430
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,873
You punk!

431
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,930
身為四代獨子 家裡一直嬌慣有加就...

432
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,873
This is my grandson.
The one that I've told you about.

433
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:33,373
Greet him properly.

434
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,073
Who is this guy?

435
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,370
不過你...

436
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:38,173
So you're Duk Hwa.

437
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,670
我

438
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:43,873
I'm someone who'll be your uncle, your
brother, your son, then your grandson.

439
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,580
怎麼了

440
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,650
曾有個在高麗出生

441
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,880
後來長眠於異國的人

442
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,950
他是你遙遠的祖先

443
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,873
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

444
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,690
你和那個孩子長得真像

445
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,373
What does that even mean?

446
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,150
在哪兒啊

447
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,560
那個祖先

448
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,573
You seem weirder and weirder
by the minute, Mister.

449
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,060
他長得帥嗎

450
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,173
You brat!

451
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,190
混小子

452
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:57,473
Oh, I offer my deepest apologies, sir.

453
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,160
微臣也不知從哪兒帶來了這樣的混小子

454
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,573
He's an only child
and was quite spoiled, you see.

455
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,100
真是無顏以對了 老爺

456
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,700
無需介懷

457
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,270
你還從未讓人失望過

458
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,000
不過話說 叔叔

459
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,173
But you...

460
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,740
你為什麼總對我爺爺用平語

461
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,973
Me? What about me?

462
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,970
你找死啊

463
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:14,973
There was a boy who was born in this land
but was laid to rest in another country.

464
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,410
混小子

465
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,080
哎喲

466
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,580
老爺

467
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,473
You're his descendant.

468
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,173
And you look just like him.

469
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,773
Which part, exactly?

470
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,060
小人來得太晚了 實在是抱歉

471
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,873
Was that ancestor of mine handsome?

472
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,773
Duk Hwa!

473
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:31,873
I have no idea how such an insolent child
came to be. My apologies, Your Lordship.

474
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,530
小人要是早些知道...

475
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:36,373
Worry not.
You've never disappointed anyone.

476
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,800
我...這

477
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:37,473
But you know, Uncle.

478
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,973
Why do you keep using
informal speech toward Grandpa?

479
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,040
氣數已盡

480
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,173
Do you have a death wish
or something?

481
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,173
Why, you little!

482
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,410
從今日起

483
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,673
Oh my...

484
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,973
<i>Your Lordship.</i>

485
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,850
這個孩子 便會侍奉老爺

486
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,220
這是小人的孫子

487
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:57,873
I offer my deepest apologies
for coming to see you so late.

488
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,120
這把刀

489
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,990
就是老爺嗎 爺爺

490
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:03,973
I've been sick all this
time, Your Lordship.

491
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:13,773
I must feel the same way
that your blade does, sir.

492
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,130
看來是你的百姓的靈魂救了你啊

493
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:22,373
From this moment on, this child
will serve you, Your Lordship.

494
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,640
然而

495
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,010
你的劍上沾滿了數千人的鮮血

496
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,873
This is my grandson.

497
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,220
對你而言 他們雖是敵人

498
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:29,373
This sword is "Your Lordship," Grandpa?

499
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,250
可他們也同樣是神所創造之物

500
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,990
你會孑然一身 在永生不滅中輪迴

501
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,190
親眼看著心愛之人的死去

502
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,460
你便不會忘記任何的死亡

503
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,973
<i>It seems that your subjects
have saved your soul.</i>

504
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,700
這既是我賜於你的獎賞

505
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,300
也是你所受到的懲罰

506
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:51,573
<i>However, your blade
is stained with blood.</i>

507
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,080
唯有鬼怪新娘 方能拔出此劍

508
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:58,673
<i>They may have been your enemies,
but they were the gods' creations.</i>

509
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,250
一旦拔出此劍

510
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,920
你便會化為虛無 得享安息

511
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:04,973
<i>So you will be immortal and alone,
watching your loved ones die before you.</i>

512
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:08,173
<i>Not a single one of those deaths
will be wiped from your memory.</i>

513
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,190
老爺

514
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:15,073
<i>This blessing is the punishment
that I am giving to you.</i>

515
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,730
我要去個地方

516
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:25,673
<i>And only the Goblin's Bride will be
able to remove that blade.</i>

517
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:31,073
<i>And when she does, you'll be able to
return to nothingness and rest in peace.</i>

518
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,550
放肆

519
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,050
侍衛都是怎麼做事的
居然讓如此大不敬之人闖進來

520
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,690
你這傢夥 這裡好歹是...

521
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,773
Your Lordship!

522
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:43,173
There is a place
where I must go.

523
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,460
你...

524
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,573
Who goes there?

525
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,473
How dare you come into
a place like this?

526
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,473
Hey, you insolent...

527
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,720
我...

528
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,590
來遲了

529
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,573
Y-you... are...

530
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,470
爺爺

531
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,510
爺爺

532
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:48,073
I was too late, it seems.

533
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,330
看來你...

534
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,173
Grandpa! Grandpa!

535
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,840
便是我所受到的第一個懲罰

536
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:06,173
Grandpa!

537
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
請您...

538
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,880
收下我吧

539
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,090
從今起 便由我來侍奉您

540
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,530
這是爺爺的遺言

541
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:26,173
It seems...

542
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,740
一心為復仇 蒙蔽了雙眼

543
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,373
that this is the first punishment
that I am receiving.

544
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,210
要如何過下去

545
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:38,573
Please... accept me.

546
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,080
我連一句問候都還沒能說出

547
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,680
即便如此

548
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,450
你還是願意嗎

549
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,773
As of this moment,
I will serve you.

550
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,873
That was my grandfather's final wish.

551
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,173
I became blinded
by my desire for revenge...

552
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:08,673
and couldn't even ask your
grandfather how he'd been.

553
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,173
And yet...

554
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,073
you wish to serve me?

555
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,960
心無雜念地看著這樣的風景 真好

556
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,000
我覺得你能這般心無雜念看著這樣的風景挺好

557
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:58,097


558
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,650
給

559
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:03,133
It's quite nice to be able to enjoy
a view like this at my leisure.

560
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,160
我肚子還很飽 老爺您吃吧

561
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,323
And I'm happy that you can enjoy
a view like this at your leisure.

562
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,000
又沒有東西可吃 你怎麼會肚子飽呢

563
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,700
我還小 哪怕只要吃一點也會飽的

564
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,140
老爺塊頭大 還是老爺您吃吧

565
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,110
那如此便是

566
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,050
離到陸地還遠著呢

567
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,780
要是分著吃 誰都填不飽肚子的

568
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,823
Here.

569
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,090
所以 你要餓著肚子嗎

570
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,760
我要實在餓了 會去船上幫忙幹活

571
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:36,323
You should have it, Your Lordship.
I'm still quite full.

572
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,360
只要稍微蹭點吃的便好

573
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,560
你以為我帶你來 就為了讓你蹭口吃的嗎

574
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,523
How is it that you're full
when you've had nothing to eat?

575
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,300
相信我

576
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,133
I'm tiny, so I get full even after
eating the tiniest morsel of food.

577
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,500
也許我的強大遠遠超出了你的想像

578
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,323
You're much bigger than I am, sir,
so please eat that instead.

579
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
趕緊的

580
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:51,523
We can do this, then.

581
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,933
We're still quite
far from land, sir.

582
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,823
Neither of us will be full
if we share this.

583
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,783
So is that why
you're insisting on starving?

584
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:05,433
I'm a child, so I can go around
to beg for food if I get hungry.

585
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:09,293
Do you think I brought you with me
just to have you go around begging?

586
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,933
Trust me.

587
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:14,723
I may be an even greater
person than you imagine.

588
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,223
Come, now.

589
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,040
老爺

590
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,240
老爺

591
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,110
可以看看你的包袱嗎

592
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,350
得減掉他的重量呢

593
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,690
老爺

594
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,933
Wow!

595
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,620
趕緊把孩子放下來

596
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,690
如此 我便饒你們一命

597
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,960
船上的風浪起得很怪異
任我怎麼看 裡面都有不吉利的人

598
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:40,723
Wow!

599
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,230
就是你小子

600
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,960
我會將你小子賣去當奴隸 留他四肢健全

601
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,900
把孩子扔下去

602
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:54,223
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!

603
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,723
Can I peek in that bag of yours?

604
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,923
We need to decrease
the weight on this boat, you see.

605
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,133
Your Lordship.
Your Lordship!

606
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,650
你可知道人類若是連禽獸都不如 會如何

607
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,923
Put that child down now.

608
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,223
If you do, I'll let you keep
your life at the very least.

609
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:13,223
It's clear there's someone among us who's
at fault for the waves being unruly.

610
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,423
I'll sell you as a slave,
so give me your hands and feet!

611
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,923
And as for this squirt,
throw him overboard.

612
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,230
便會造就憤怒之神

613
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,923
Do you know what happens to
humans who are lesser than animals?

614
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,420
鬼...鬼...是鬼怪

615
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,423
They meet the God of Wrath.

616
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,423
H-h-he's a goblin!

617
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
救救我

618
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,230
遲了

619
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,023
Please, spare us!

620
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:26,923
It's too late.

621
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,200
心無雜念 就這麼回來了真好

622
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,323
It sure is nice to be back
here at my leisure.

623
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,880
拜託 救救我吧

624
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,870
如果有神 求您了

625
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,400
救救...我吧

626
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,923
Why? Why did you do that?

627
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,040
救救我吧

628
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,680
隨便哪位都好 求您了

629
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,623
<i>If there is a god, please...</i>

630
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,523
<i>please, save me.</i>

631
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,233
<i>Please, save me.</i>

632
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,733
<i>Just anybody, please. Save me!</i>

633
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,080
救救我

634
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
我是隨便哪位

635
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:12,660
求您了 求您救救我吧

636
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,290
這個嘛

637
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,200
我的原則便是不干涉人類的生死

638
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,470
我...

639
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,740
我...不能就這麼死了

640
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,623
Who are you?

641
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,123
I'm "just anybody."

642
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,880
看來 你要我救的並不是你啊

643
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:42,233
Please... please, help me.

644
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:50,530
求...孩...只要救下孩子便好

645
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,423
Well, I don't know.

646
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,323
It's my rule not to get involved
in human beings' lives.

647
00:39:55,323 --> 00:40:01,733
I... really can't
just die like this.

648
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:09,233
The one you're asking me
to save isn't you, is it?

649
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,780
你今天很走運

650
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,590
遇到了如此心軟的神

651
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,590
今晚我不想見到有人死去

652
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,823
Just my child, at least. Please.

653
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:46,623
You're lucky, though, to have
met a soft-hearted god like me.

654
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:50,923
It's just that I don't want
to see anyone die tonight.

655
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,740
雪

656
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,610
和血

657
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,920
還有花

658
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,033
<i>[JI YEON HEE. 27 YEARS OLD. BORN IN
THE YEAR OF THE TIGER ON MARCH 1ST.]</i>

659
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:03,643
<i>[NO NAME. ZERO YEARS OLD.]</i>

660
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:19,080
是鬼怪新娘

661
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,923
Snow, and rain, and...

662
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,423
flowers, eh?

663
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,530
<i>-=8年後=-</i>

664
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>- The Goblin's Bride is back.
- The Goblin's Bride is back.</i>

665
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,240
我們家恩卓 今年的生日想要什麼樣的年糕

666
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,140
甜年糕

667
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,710
彩虹年糕

668
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,150
媽媽

669
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,350
我能不能不要開生日宴了 直接開個派對呢

670
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,590
有什麼不一樣的啊

671
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,323
<i>[EIGHT YEARS LATER]</i>

672
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,790
年糕蛋糕不一樣啊

673
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,460
我也想要吹蠟燭許願呢

674
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,090
總是對著年糕許願 總覺得根本不管用呢

675
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,200
看來媽媽沒給你準備生日蛋糕啊

676
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,130
媽媽是看你喜歡吃年糕 才給你年糕的嘛

677
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,070
好吧

678
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,600
從今年起 我們就開派對

679
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:22,733
What do you want for your
birthday this year, Eun Tak?

680
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,700
也會吃蛋糕

681
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,870
哇 媽媽最棒啦

682
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,623
Round rice cakes?
Square rice cakes?

683
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,740
哦 是小狗

684
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,110
咦 小狗

685
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:30,623
Mom. Can't I have a party now
instead of Korean-style parties?

686
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,923
What's the difference?

687
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,323
Well, a cake instead of
rice cakes, for one.

688
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,923
I want to blow out candles
and make a wish too.

689
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,733
I think the reason why my
wish isn't coming true is because

690
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,120
你看這個

691
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,423
I've been making my wishes on rice
cakes instead of birthday candles.

692
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,860
春天又來了

693
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,760
神奇吧

694
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,733
Oh, I didn't realize!

695
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,123
I only got you rice cakes
because you like them!

696
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,233
All right, then. Let's throw you
a party with cake from now on.

697
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,923
Wow! You're the best, Mom!

698
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:55,923
Oh, it's a puppy!

699
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:57,023
Huh? A puppy?

700
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,480
哎喲喂 好累

701
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,180
媽媽

702
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,010
我今天英語考了一百分呢

703
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,320
用了太多的腦子 超累的

704
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,490
是嗎

705
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,233
Look at this.
It's spring again.

706
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,020
哇 是蛋糕哎

707
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,320
媽媽 我們這是要開派對嗎

708
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,923
Isn't that fascinating?

709
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,030
嗯

710
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,190
趕緊過來坐吧

711
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,830
點蠟燭

712
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:27,947


713
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,960
我可以點嗎

714
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,570
我們家恩卓現在長大了 你可以點

715
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,940
對哦 我可九歲了呢

716
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,470
英語都考了一百分 這點事兒還不是小菜一碟

717
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:29,923
Ah, I'm so tired.

718
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,780
這種話 你又是從哪兒學來的啊

719
00:44:29,923 --> 00:44:32,623
Mom, I got a 100 on
my English quiz today!

720
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,940
媽媽你不用知道啦

721
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,733
I'm super-duper tired because
I used so much brainpower today!

722
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,680
我就是透過各種人 學話學得夠好了

723
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,123
Oh, really?

724
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,150
我看啊 我可能是個天才...

725
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,623
Wow! It's cake!

726
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:43,233
Are we going to have
a party now, Mom?

727
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,590
怎麼了

728
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,420
你得許願啊

729
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:47,623
Yeah. Come and sit.
Light the candles.

730
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,060
祝你生日快樂哦 我的小寶貝

731
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,330
原來不是你啊

732
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,423
Is it okay for me to light them?

733
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,923
You can do it since you're
all grown up now, Eun Tak.

734
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,523
Oh yeah.
I'm nine years old now.

735
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,970
原來真的不是媽媽

736
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:59,123
I even got a 100 on my English
quiz, so this is a cakewalk.

737
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,600
而是媽媽的靈魂

738
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:01,323
Where did you learn that saying?

739
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,010
你

740
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,123
You don't need to know, Mom.

741
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,880
真的都能看見呀

742
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:07,233
I'm just good at picking up these
things from all sorts of people.

743
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:10,423
I think I might be a genius...

744
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,020
媽媽本來不希望這樣的

745
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:16,023
What's the matter?
You have to make a wish.

746
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:17,360
媽媽死了嗎

747
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,323
Happy birthday, my little pup!

748
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,023
It's not really you, Mom.

749
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,460
真的嗎

750
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:29,123
It's your spirit that
I'm talking to, isn't it?

751
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,100
媽媽在哪裡

752
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:37,123
So... you really can see
everything, can't you?

753
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,670
媽媽現在在哪裡

754
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,110
我在十字路口的醫院裡

755
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:42,323
I was hoping that you
wouldn't be able to.

756
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,233
Are you dead, Mom?

757
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,020
醫院會聯繫你的

758
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,190
去了之後 姨媽馬上就會到

759
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:55,023
Really?

760
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,660
晚上很冷 記得帶圍巾

761
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,560
去找小賣部奶奶和你一起去

762
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,030
能找到小賣部奶奶吧

763
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,923
Where are you, Mom?
Where are you now?

764
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,650
從洗衣店路口往下走

765
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:07,623
At Sageori Hospital.

766
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,870
就在一下去的右手邊

767
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
真聰明 我的小寶貝

768
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,580
以後絕對不要和靈魂對視

769
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,150
知道了嗎

770
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:20,733
You'll be getting
a call from the hospital.

771
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,050
對不起 媽媽

772
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,523
And when you get there,
your aunt will arrive soon.

773
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,950
因為我能看見那些

774
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,990
但就是因為我能看見那些

775
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:27,023
It's cold at night, so make
sure you have a scarf on.

776
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:30,123
Ask the granny at the supermarket
to go with you too. Okay?

777
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,160
才能看見媽媽

778
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,323
You know how to get to
her place, right?

779
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:38,323
Go down the alleyway next to
the dry cleaners and then make a right.

780
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,270
所以 我沒關係

781
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,700
好

782
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:40,623
Oh, you're so clever,
my little pup!

783
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,010
你能這樣看著媽媽

784
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:48,423
Don't ever look another spirit
in the eye from now on, okay?

785
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,240
謝謝你

786
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,910
恩卓

787
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:53,623
I'm sorry, Mom, that I can see spirits.

788
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,280
媽媽...

789
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,260
媽媽現在似乎該走了

790
00:46:55,023 --> 00:47:01,523
But it's because I can see spirits
that I can see you now.

791
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,890
我愛你 我家小寶貝

792
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,733
I'm okay, Mom.

793
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,370
我也是

794
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,243
Okay.

795
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,470
我也愛你 媽媽

796
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,570
媽媽再見

797
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,523
Thank you so much...

798
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,370
媽媽走好

799
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,940
媽媽一定要去天堂 好嗎

800
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,623
for seeing me like this.

801
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,280
一定

802
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:27,523
I... I think that
I have to go now.

803
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,010
一定哦

804
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,523
I love you, my little pup.

805
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,160
媽媽

806
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:39,823
Me too.
I love you too, Mom.

807
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:43,823
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

808
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:48,823
You have to go to heaven, okay?

809
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,470
媽媽

810
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,533
You have to!

811
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,590
你好 請問是池蓮熙家嗎

812
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,150
這裡是十字路口第一醫院

813
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,160
我知道 我會去的

814
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,823
Mom!

815
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,133
Mom!

816
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,533
<i>Hello? Is this
Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home?</i>

817
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,150
願望

818
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,250
我才不要許願

819
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,723
<i>This is Sageori Jaeil
Hospital, and...</i>

820
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,520
一個都不許

821
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:36,823
I know.
I'll head over there.

822
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
反正沒有人會聽

823
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
向誰許願呢

824
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,050
奶奶怎麼都不會老呢

825
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,923
I'm not going to make a wish.

826
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,323
I'm not going to make
even a single wish.

827
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,820
還能怎麼繼續老呢

828
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,323
Nobody ever grants
them for me anyway.

829
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,133
So who would I even
make the wish to?

830
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,520
那倒也是

831
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:20,870
偶爾照顧一下我們恩卓 不行嗎

832
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,430
不要

833
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,670
你的女兒 我為什麼要照顧

834
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,440
我說偶爾嘛

835
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,170
如果有剩下的白菜就給她一點

836
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,210
菠菜也給一點

837
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:34,923
How is it that you never
seem to grow old, Granny?

838
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,780
所以 那時候一起死多好

839
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,780
為什麼非要多活這些日子

840
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:38,533
How could I possibly get
any older than this?

841
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,250
你這話說的

842
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,923
You do have a point.

843
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,720
明明是奶奶告訴我的

844
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,720
讓我虔誠地祈求

845
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:51,633
Can't you check up on my Eun Tak
every once in a while?

846
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,160
竟然會有人相信那句話

847
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,460
就因為相信了那句話

848
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,530
我才能多活一段時間

849
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,133
Spouting such nonsense again.

850
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,133
Why would I check up
on your daughter?

851
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,930
謝謝你 奶奶

852
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,923
Just every once in a while!

853
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,633
Give her some leftover
cabbage if you have any

854
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,633
and some spinach, too.

855
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,610
我是來和你道別的

856
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,423
You should've just died then. Why did you
have to ask them to give you more time?

857
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,950
我要走了

858
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,903
You're so mean.

859
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,533
You're the one who told me
to plead with them with all my heart.

860
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,823
And you actually believed that?

861
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,323
And thanks to that, I got to live
for a bit longer before I had to go.

862
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,633
Thanks for everything, Granny.

863
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,423
I came to say goodbye.

864
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:40,423
I'm... going now.

865
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,120
叔... 叔叔是誰

866
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,990
你

867
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,530
看得到我嗎

868
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,030
圍巾 我沒戴圍巾

869
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:10,447


870
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,500
我要被媽媽罵了

871
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,570
你明明戴了 圍巾

872
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,400
這裡是池蓮熙家吧

873
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,240
因為她不在醫院 我才來的

874
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,270
不過怎麼會...

875
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,610
你本是不該出生的孩子

876
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,533
Who are you, Mister?

877
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,760
你今年是9歲嗎

878
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:24,823
You... can see me?

879
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,060
我根本聽不到叔叔的聲音

880
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,323
Oh, my scarf. I didn't put it on.
Mom's going to yell at me.

881
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,560
您怎麼會在這兒

882
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,223
You have it on already, though.

883
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,423
This is Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home, right?

884
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,500
-走吧 別管這個孩子
-奶奶

885
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:38,823
I came here since her spirit
wasn't at the hospital.

886
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:44,633
But how is a child like you, who wasn't
supposed to have been born...

887
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,580
您這是妨礙公務

888
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,680
什麼妨礙公務

889
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,410
都什麼時候的事了 你現在才來做

890
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:50,863
??

891
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,380
現在能做真是萬幸

892
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,533
Did you, by any chance,
become nine years old this year?

893
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,150
我現在沒有時間

894
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,950
那是你的事情

895
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,890
這個孩子在生死簿上嗎

896
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,633
I can't hear your voice
at all, Mister.

897
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,820
雖然當時那個孩子無名

898
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:04,223
What brings you here, ma'am?

899
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,790
但現在這個孩子是有名字的

900
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,130
如果有寫著這孩子名字的生死簿

901
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,400
你倒是拿給我看看

902
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,860
那我就放她走

903
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,533
Go. And leave this child alone.

904
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,770
如果要得到冥府的協助

905
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:09,923
Granny!

906
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,200
就要有9年內所有的證明

907
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,900
您明知道...

908
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:17,223
You're getting in the way of my work.

909
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:19,133
As if.

910
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,923
Why are you trying to take her now
when it's already been so long?

911
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:23,133
I'm glad for this chance.
Better late than never.

912
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,150
再見

913
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:24,723
I have no time right now.

914
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,533
That's your problem.

915
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,520
小朋友

916
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,723
Do you have this child's
name on your list?

917
00:52:28,723 --> 00:52:32,533
She had no name back then,
but she has a name now.

918
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:36,133
If you have a certificate with
her name on it, hand it over.

919
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,260
奶奶 我媽媽...

920
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,130
我知道 那沒辦法

921
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,723
I'll hand her over if you do.

922
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:41,823
If I'm going to get that, I need to get
nine years' worth of evidence on her.

923
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,560
你得好好活著

924
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,870
你要趕緊搬家 在3天內

925
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:43,633
You, of all people, should know...

926
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,730
這樣他才找不到你

927
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,270
你和地獄使者對視了

928
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,570
不能繼續在這裡生活了

929
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,040
如果搬走的話 他就找不到我嗎

930
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,710
找不到

931
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,050
所以才說選址很重要

932
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:57,033
I'll be seeing you again, child.

933
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,980
過了今日子夜

934
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:04,420
會有一男兩女到殯儀館找你

935
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:06,033
Granny! Mom is...

936
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,090
跟著他們走吧

937
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:08,923
I know. And we can't
do anything about that.

938
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,133
But you have to live.

939
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,100
可能往後日子有點辛苦

940
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:14,323
You have to move within three days
if you don't want him to find you.

941
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,230
但你沒有別的選擇

942
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:18,923
You've looked a God of Death in the
eye, so you can't live here any longer.

943
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:20,670
但是為什麼要告訴我這些呢

944
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:21,723
He won't be able to
find me if I move?

945
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,570
因為我喜歡你

946
00:53:21,723 --> 00:53:23,423
No, he won't.

947
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:25,633
That's why land is so important.

948
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,010
你出生的時候

949
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:34,823
After midnight, a man and two women
will come for you at the funeral parlor.

950
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,850
我覺得很幸福

951
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,120
這是給你的生日禮物

952
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:36,723
Go with them.

953
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:44,823
It'll be hard on you,
but you have no other choice.

954
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,923
But why are you telling
me all of this?

955
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,133
Because I've taken a liking to you.

956
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,423
When she was pregnant with you...

957
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,533
she was so happy.

958
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:07,423
Here. A birthday gift.

959
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,160
<i>-=10年後=-</i>

960
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,450
那個...

961
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,730
我們一起喝一杯吧

962
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,400
好呀

963
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,133
<i>[10 YEARS LATER]</i>

964
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,470
不是 昨天還好好的卡

965
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,410
突然就不能用了

966
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,740
所以我想說 叔叔

967
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,540
酒吧裡不是有穿著西裝

968
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,880
不太友好的男人嘛

969
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,650
我現在和那些傢夥...

970
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,650
那些人在一起

971
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,133
Excuse me.

972
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,950
所以 拜託你接一下電話吧

973
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,420
他們讓我說出你的手機號

974
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,990
我說我叔叔沒有手機

975
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,590
他們就對我特別不友好

976
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:22,323
Want to get a drink with me?

977
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,530
叔叔 你在聽嗎

978
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,323
Sure.

979
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,460
叔叔

980
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,500
叔叔

981
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,770
叔叔

982
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:32,723
<i>This card worked up until
yesterday, but now it doesn't!</i>

983
00:55:32,723 --> 00:55:34,423
<i>So, um, Uncle.</i>

984
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:36,140
高三都要結束了她還是一個人吃飯

985
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,633
<i>There are some unfriendly
guys in suits at the bar.</i>

986
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,510
覺得她可憐 就去一起吃啊

987
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,080
瘋了嗎 我為什麼要那樣

988
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:42,133
<i>I'm, um, with those people right now.</i>

989
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,810
她能看見鬼

990
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,950
比起鬼 我覺得她更可怕

991
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,423
<i>So please, pick up the phone!</i>

992
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,220
至少我們看不見鬼

993
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,423
<i>They asked for your cell phone number</i>

994
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:49,823
<i>and got really unfriendly when
I told them that you don't have one.</i>

995
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,690
你們看她

996
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,690
明明聽得到 卻還裝聽不到

997
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,823
<i>Uncle. Are you listening?</i>

998
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:57,133
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

999
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,533
<i>Uncle!</i>

1000
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,723
She still eats by herself even
though it's the end of senior year.

1001
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,170
喂

1002
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,133
If you feel that bad for her,
go and eat with her yourself.

1003
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,410
喂 聽說你是鬼怪新娘

1004
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,923
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

1005
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:12,633
That girl sees spirits!

1006
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,580
你明明看得到我

1007
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,323
I'm more scared of her
than I am of ghosts.

1008
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:16,723
At least you can't see ghosts.

1009
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:18,520
和我一起走吧 我太孤單了

1010
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:21,533
Look. She can hear everything we're
saying, but she's acting as if she can't.

1011
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,690
喂 你為什麼裝作看不見我

1012
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,260
壞女人

1013
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,260
這個外形真是...

1014
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,860
看吧 你明明看得見我

1015
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,923
Hey.

1016
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,000
傳聞是真的

1017
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,370
對... 對不起 對不起 對不起

1018
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:41,033
Hey, I heard that
you're the Goblin's Bride.

1019
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:44,533
Come on, I know you can see me.

1020
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,710
什麼呀

1021
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,180
怎麼莫名其妙的道歉

1022
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,323
Come with me.
It's just that I'm so lonely!

1023
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:49,323
Please?

1024
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,533
Hey, why do you keep ignoring me?

1025
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:56,133
You evil girl!

1026
00:56:57,223 --> 00:56:58,923
Oh, geez!

1027
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:02,133
See? I knew you could see me.

1028
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:11,923
Wait, so it's true?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1029
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:17,823
What was that? Why did she
apologize all of the sudden?

1030
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:44,430
也不開燈

1031
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,630
我想事情想得太入神了

1032
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,270
這是你在國外的住處

1033
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,530
<i>-=大韓民國=-</i>

1034
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,650
這麼快...

1035
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,180
是的 很快

1036
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,820
德華都已經25歲了

1037
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:13,223
You didn't even turn on
any of the lights, Your Lordship.

1038
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,560
我已經讓他多去見識見識了

1039
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,830
這個月底左右再走吧

1040
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:16,483
I was lost in my thoughts.

1041
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:22,123
These are the materials you
requested of me from the NIS.

1042
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,300
您這次離開

1043
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:29,240
估計我很難再見到您了

1044
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:30,303
Then...

1045
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,723
Yes. It's happened, Your Lordship.

1046
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:37,680
感謝你

1047
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:39,323
Duk Hwa is already 25 years old now.

1048
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,050
陪我走過每一個瞬間

1049
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:44,723
I've pulled a lot of strings so you can
leave near the end of the month.

1050
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:47,260
當您歸來時 德華會在這裡

1051
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,723
If you leave now, Your Lordship...

1052
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,630
我總忘記帶鑰匙

1053
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,623
this will be the last time in
my lifetime I'll see you, correct?

1054
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,470
所以換成了密碼鎖

1055
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,410
爺爺 叔叔

1056
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,210
叔叔 原來你在這裡

1057
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:09,533
I thank you for every second
that we've shared together.

1058
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,450
我差點跪下求你來接我了

1059
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,050
可你都沒挪過地方

1060
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,620
長輩在說話 小孩子不要亂插嘴

1061
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,823
Duk Hwa will be here
when you return, sir.

1062
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,190
是爺爺消了我的卡 對不對

1063
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,090
是你消的 對不對

1064
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,920
是我秘書消的 臭小子

1065
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,560
我丟臉丟到姥姥家了 好不容易撩到的

1066
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:25,083
I've been losing my keys
all the time lately

1067
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,060
早知如此 幹嘛把我弄成富三代

1068
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,593
so I've had the lock
changed to a keyless one.

1069
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,023
Grandpa! Uncle Shin!

1070
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:31,340
叔叔 你要走了嗎

1071
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,470
去哪兒

1072
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:37,383
There you are, Uncle Shin.
I begged you to come and pick me up.

1073
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,510
說了多少遍 改改你的口氣

1074
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,410
爺爺 您先打住

1075
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:39,293
But here you are.

1076
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,043
Do not interrupt an adults' conversation!

1077
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:43,150
難道是那件事 找你的新娘

1078
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:46,420
我說 去國際婚姻就去唄 為什麼不說出來

1079
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,523
Did you cancel my card?

1080
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,573
You canceled my card, didn't you!

1081
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,220
為什麼不說出來

1082
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:49,333
Yeah, I canceled it, you brat.

1083
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:52,813
Ugh, I was totally humiliated!
Do you know how tough she was to get to?

1084
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,990
等我回來 就有這孩子 是嗎

1085
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,143
Why did you even make me your heir
if you were going to treat me like this?

1086
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:56,960
叔叔 哪天 幾點 什麼時候去

1087
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,193
Uncle Shin, are you going somewhere?

1088
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:06,913
- Where are you going?
- I told you to speak with more respect!

1089
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,223
Stay out of this, Grandpa.

1090
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:12,533
Is it about that thing again?
About you looking for your bride?

1091
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:15,833
Why can't you just say that you're
leaving to get married somewhere?

1092
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,833
Why can't you say it!

1093
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,453
You're saying this kid will be here
when I return?

1094
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:26,443
Uncle Shin, exactly when
and what time are you leaving?

1095
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,010
吃早飯了 一位男士兩位女士

1096
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,450
吃飯啦

1097
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,050
瞎喊什麼

1098
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,090
做個早飯能不能安靜點

1099
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,390
今天怎麼是海帶湯

1100
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:10,467


1101
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,760
誰過生日嗎

1102
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,260
給力 這傢夥煮海帶湯慶祝自己生日嗎

1103
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,700
看來沒錯

1104
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,100
剋死自己媽媽的出生日期

1105
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,900
還好意思慶祝

1106
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,970
不學無術 所以也不知道什麼叫丟人

1107
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,713
One male and two females!
Your breakfast is ready.

1108
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,640
這話有理

1109
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,510
她在我們這兒十年了

1110
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,980
吃你的飯吧

1111
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:19,613
I said, your breakfast is ready.

1112
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,050
謝謝您給我過生日 姨媽

1113
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:23,503
Shut up, you loudmouth.

1114
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:26,803
Why are you blabbering so much over
the stupid breakfast you cooked?

1115
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,850
所以說 烏髮畜生不知恩啊

1116
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,233
What's with the seaweed soup?
Is it someone's birthday today?

1117
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,620
多情也是病啊

1118
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,790
真替死去的她感到不值

1119
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,723
Are you kidding me? Did she make the soup
because it's her birthday or something?

1120
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,560
我還把你辛辛苦苦拉扯大

1121
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,430
您這說得就有點過分了

1122
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,263
Yeah, it is.

1123
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:40,243
How can she be proud of having killed her
own mom just to be born on this day?

1124
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,990
有什麼過分的

1125
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,930
對你來說 是媽媽 可也是我的姐姐

1126
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,200
所以說啊
無論是內心還是血緣關係 我離她更近

1127
01:02:40,243 --> 01:02:42,463
She's shameless because
she doesn't know any better.

1128
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,970
媽 你知道你在說什麼嗎

1129
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,883
Whatever she learned, she got it from you
since she's been with us for 10 years.

1130
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,400
吃你的飯去

1131
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,563
Shut up and eat your food.

1132
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,070
往哪兒逃

1133
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,540
不是逃 而是上學

1134
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:51,083
Thanks for wishing me a happy birthday.

1135
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:56,263
This is why people say that
you should never take in a stray.

1136
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:58,023
Being too compassionate is my downfall.

1137
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:02,073
I'm the pitiful one here since
I've raised her in her mother's stead.

1138
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,980
敢拿雨傘打死你

1139
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,090
放學以後帶上存摺去銀行

1140
01:03:02,073 --> 01:03:04,603
Your words are a bit harsh.

1141
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,360
今天還不帶來 你知道什麼後果

1142
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,433
How is it harsh?

1143
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,190
我說了 我沒有存摺

1144
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,413
She may be your mom,
but she's my older sister.

1145
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:09,030
到底要說幾遍

1146
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:11,563
Exactly. She and I are closer in
both heart and connection.

1147
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:15,093
- Do you even know what you're saying?
- Shut up and eat your food.

1148
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,370
那存摺在哪

1149
01:03:15,093 --> 01:03:17,483
Where are you running off to?

1150
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,970
你媽的保險金在哪

1151
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:20,283
I'm not running off anywhere.
I'm going to school.

1152
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,610
我怎麼知道

1153
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,110
都被你拿走了 被你全拿走了

1154
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:30,053
You're dead if you touch those umbrellas.

1155
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,450
大清早的浪費口水

1156
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,513
Meet me at the bank
with your bankbook after school.

1157
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:34,593
You know what will happen
if you don't, right?

1158
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,750
廢話少說 記得帶來

1159
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:38,223
How many times have I told you
that I don't have a bankbook?

1160
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,290
不想被打死的話

1161
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,390
在背包裡的存摺 怎麼一到銀行就不翼而飛

1162
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,790
如果不是你 還能是誰

1163
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,160
早說了 這女的鬼上身了

1164
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:47,443
Then where's the bankbook?
Where's your mom's insurance money?

1165
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,830
你說得對 你後背上趴著鬼

1166
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,270
什麼 你這傢夥

1167
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,993
How would I know that?

1168
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:58,673
You took all the money for yourself!
You even took the money from our house!

1169
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:02,693
Why is she talking
so much crap this morning?

1170
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:05,623
Just shut up and bring it
unless you want to get your ass beaten.

1171
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:07,933
The bankbook disappears whenever
I need to go to the bank

1172
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,163
and who else could it be but you?

1173
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,813
I'm telling you that
the bitch is possessed.

1174
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:15,233
That's right.
There's a ghost right behind you.

1175
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,793
What! You crazy bitch!

1176
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,710
可是 老爺

1177
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:04,210
這次也是獨自離開嗎

1178
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,250
是啊

1179
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,780
我遇到的那些女子 都看不到那把劍

1180
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,420
我是感到慶幸

1181
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:21,460
您因那把劍飽受煎熬時 我希望新娘能早日出現

1182
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,200
而像現在這般平靜時 又希望誰都不知道

1183
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,700
這就是人類的貪念吧

1184
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:29,773
<i>My lordship.</i>

1185
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:34,173
Will you be traveling alone
this time too?

1186
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,970
我也感到慶幸

1187
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,523
Yes, it would seem so.

1188
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,810
你還陪伴在我身邊

1189
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:41,283
No women I've ever met has been
able to see the sword.

1190
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,580
而且有一大瓶酒

1191
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,120
今晚我想活著

1192
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,613
Which is of a great relief to me.

1193
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:50,643
I hope the bride appears quickly for you
when you're in agony over the sword.

1194
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,820
那就乾杯吧

1195
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:55,323
But if the sword is seen,
I hope no one finds out about it.

1196
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:59,493
That's just human greed, I guess.

1197
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:03,973
It's a relief for me too.

1198
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:09,733
To still have you by my side,
and a full drink in my hand besides.

1199
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:13,313
For tonight at least,
I'd like to remain alive.

1200
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,633
Shall we drink to that?

1201
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:24,690
我九歲那年下定決心再也不做這種事了

1202
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,460
可當時太心急了 還望您諒解

1203
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,700
請讓我找到一份兼職

1204
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,360
請讓姨媽一家別這麼對我

1205
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,300
請賜給我一個男朋友 求您了

1206
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,810
請讓我找到一份兼職

1207
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,640
請讓姨媽一家別這麼對我

1208
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,350
請想想辦法 救救苦命的我

1209
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,780
一丁點也行啊

1210
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:54,053
When I was nine years old,
I told myself that I'd never do this.

1211
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,333
But I'm desperate right now,
so I hope you understand.

1212
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,750
我在幹什麼

1213
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,820
求誰啊

1214
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,930
哪有什麼神仙

1215
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,883
Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives

1216
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:06,083
and please help me find a boyfriend!

1217
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,063
<i>Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives</i>

1218
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,843
and help me improve my pathetic life.

1219
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,210
難不成還要下雨嗎

1220
01:07:16,843 --> 01:07:18,883
Even 100 won in my pocket
would be fine! Please.

1221
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,280
這是場雷陣雨 還是苦雨啊

1222
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,250
這雨會停吧

1223
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,863
What in the world am I doing?

1224
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:29,790
就弟弟妹妹有雨傘 為什麼還總下雨

1225
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:28,033
Who am I even praying to?

1226
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,493
There is no god.

1227
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,760
是你嗎

1228
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,160
嚇死我了

1229
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,760
我嗎

1230
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:47,113
You're seriously not going to
make it rain right now, are you?

1231
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,210
我嗎

1232
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:50,673
It's not even the rainy season!

1233
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,940
你是在和我說話嗎

1234
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:53,473
Will the rain even stop?
Will it ever?

1235
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,610
對 你

1236
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:58,993
Why do you keep making it rain when
I don't even have an umbrella of my own?

1237
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,080
是你嗎

1238
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,780
什麼

1239
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,180
把我叫來的人是不是你

1240
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,080
我嗎 我沒叫你

1241
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,050
你叫了

1242
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:03,733
- Was it you?
- Oh my goodness.

1243
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,420
你到底怎麼叫我出來的

1244
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,620
我沒做什麼啊 真的沒叫你

1245
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,530
你分明叫了

1246
01:08:07,073 --> 01:08:08,943
Me?

1247
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,290
好好想想是怎麼叫的

1248
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,030
迫切的

1249
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,100
不是我叫你的

1250
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,500
只是我的眼睛能看到你

1251
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:17,863
Me?

1252
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,470
上次在大街上和你對視了

1253
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,913
- Were you talking to me?
- Yeah, you.

1254
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,810
是那位叔叔 對不對

1255
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:23,913
Was it you?

1256
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,623
- What about me?
- Were you the one who summoned me?

1257
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,840
能看到 你這是什麼意思

1258
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,650
你不是鬼嗎

1259
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:30,283
- Me? I didn't summon you.
- You did summon me.

1260
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,350
我能看到鬼

1261
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:33,423
- But just how did you summon me?
- How would I have summoned you?

1262
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,050
我不是鬼

1263
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:33,080
一開始都這麼說

1264
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:37,003
- I seriously didn't summon you.
- You definitely did summon me.

1265
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,460
你到底是什麼人

1266
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:40,563
- Try to remember how you summoned me.
- Desperately?

1267
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,860
為什麼本該看到的東西一點也看不到了

1268
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,560
應該看到什麼

1269
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:46,983
I didn't summon you.
I'm just able to see you.

1270
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,930
20歲 30歲 你的未來

1271
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,300
看來我可能沒有未來吧

1272
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:50,593
Because we accidentally locked eyes
when we passed each other the other day.

1273
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,200
話說回來 你死之前是跳大繩的嗎

1274
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:53,213
You're him, aren't you?

1275
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,770
還是騙子

1276
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:57,013
- What do you mean, you can see me?
- You're a ghost, aren't you?

1277
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,340
還什麼未來呢

1278
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,080
什...什麼 什麼子

1279
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:59,483
I'm able to see ghosts.

1280
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,640
請你往生極樂吧

1281
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:02,563
- I'm not a ghost.
- That's what they all say at first.

1282
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,480
徘徊太久不好的

1283
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,190
可那花是怎麼回事

1284
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:07,663
Who are you?

1285
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,490
你不是叫我往生極樂嗎 還搭話

1286
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,333
Why can't you see what you
should see right in front of you?

1287
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:10,920
知道了 快去往生吧

1288
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:14,123
- What am I supposed to see?
- Your twenties, thirties... your future.

1289
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,720
蕎麥花

1290
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,160
我不是問這個

1291
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:17,113
Maybe because there is no future for me.

1292
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
我問的是你為什麼要拿在手裡

1293
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,130
給我吧 和你不搭

1294
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:23,353
Were you a shaman or something
before you died? Or a con man?

1295
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,000
頭一次聽到有人這麼說

1296
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,100
真的是頭一次 真的

1297
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:27,613
- My future, my butt.
- What? A con, what?

1298
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,840
給我吧

1299
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:31,743
Go to the light.
Wandering around for too long isn't good.

1300
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,640
今天是我的生日

1301
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,950
非常憂鬱的生日

1302
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:37,923
- What's with those flowers?
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

1303
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,563
Okay, leave.

1304
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:41,633
They're buckwheat flowers.

1305
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:46,433
But that's not what I'm asking.
Why are you holding those flowers?

1306
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:49,663
Give them to me.
They don't really suit you.

1307
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,230
看來 我的生日禮物和草有緣

1308
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,000
9歲時 我收到的是大白菜

1309
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,713
I've never been told that before.
I've seriously never been told that.

1310
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:58,740
可蕎麥花的花語是什麼呢

1311
01:09:55,293 --> 01:09:57,483
You can just give them to me.

1312
01:09:57,483 --> 01:10:00,223
It's my birthday today.

1313
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,070
戀人

1314
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,393
A very depressing birthday.

1315
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:19,233
I get nothing but weeds for my birthday.

1316
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:22,433
I got a napa cabbage
for my ninth birthday.

1317
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:27,863
But what is the meaning
of these buckwheat flowers?

1318
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,600
你為什麼在哭

1319
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:29,823
Lovers.

1320
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,340
兼職 姨媽一家 男朋友 三個當中因為哪個

1321
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,670
你怎麼知道的

1322
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,940
聽到了

1323
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,010
聽到了...是什麼意思

1324
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,510
我有時會幫人實現願望

1325
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:42,610
幫人實現願望

1326
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:52,847


1327
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,590
像有魔力那樣的守護神那種嗎

1328
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,960
真的啊 我就說嘛

1329
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:56,260
看你的第一眼 就覺得和其他鬼不一樣

1330
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:57,233
Why were you crying?

1331
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,960
真的是我的守護神嗎

1332
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,593
Job, relatives, or boyfriend?
Which of the three were you crying over?

1333
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,260
我可沒說是你的守護神

1334
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,100
我媽說過

1335
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,343
- How did you know that?
- I heard you.

1336
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,370
每個人出生時都帶著屬於自己的字典

1337
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,463
What do you mean, you heard it?

1338
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,370
而我的字典裡

1339
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:12,810
無論怎麼翻找也找不到幸福 幸運這種詞

1340
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,803
- I grant some people their wishes.
- You grant people their wishes?

1341
01:11:13,593 --> 01:11:17,773
Like a magic genie?
Or a guardian angel?

1342
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,220
你懂我的意思吧

1343
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,380
不懂

1344
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:21,243
Are you serious?
I knew it.

1345
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,990
就是問你 能不能通融個五百萬之類的

1346
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:25,493
I knew you were different from other
ghosts from the moment I first saw you.

1347
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,790
如果不能用現金
告訴我本週的彩券開獎號碼也好

1348
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:28,673
- Are you really my guardian angel?
- I didn't say I was your guardian angel.

1349
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:26,860
這也是願望之一

1350
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,930
你和家人告個別

1351
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:33,773
My mom once told me that everyone is born
with their own life dictionary.

1352
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,360
估計有段時間見不到他們了

1353
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,760
在雞肉店努力打工 會被錄用的

1354
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:41,553
And in my dictionary, words such as
"Luck" or "Fortune" don't exist.

1355
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,270
我說...

1356
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,710
那我男朋友呢

1357
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:46,010
我說...你在嗎

1358
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:47,393
- You know what I mean, right?
- No, I don't.

1359
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,550
真是的 小氣鬼

1360
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,203
I'm asking if I can have
about five million.

1361
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:56,073
If getting me the cash is too tough,
then tell me the winning lottery numbers.

1362
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:59,643
Go and say goodbye to your family.
You won't get to see them for a while.

1363
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,813
Keep looking for a job at a chicken
restaurant. You'll find something soon.

1364
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,060
似曾相識

1365
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,930
確實如此

1366
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,200
聽說過有關你的許多傳聞

1367
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,970
我的傳聞裡有很多虛假的

1368
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:11,903
Hey! What about my boyfriend?

1369
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:13,140
來我家有何貴幹

1370
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:14,973
Hello? Hey!

1371
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,510
你住在這裡

1372
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:18,240
這裡傢俱齊全 您只要住進來...

1373
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:18,033
Ugh, what a poor sport!

1374
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,980
你什麼時候回來的 叔叔

1375
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:23,980
解釋

1376
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,220
叔叔 反正這裡要空著20年

1377
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,320
所以我就想 這20年得多少房租啊

1378
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,220
我就以這單純的好奇心為出發點...

1379
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:35,133
- I haven't met you before.
- Likewise.

1380
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,890
你知道這傢伙是幹什麼的嗎

1381
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,660
跟這東西...

1382
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,473
But I have heard rumors.

1383
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,830
你對新住戶太沒禮貌了

1384
01:12:37,473 --> 01:12:40,313
There are all sorts of rumors about me.

1385
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,430
他說要開茶店

1386
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,403
What are you doing in my home?

1387
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:44,400
不好意思 我叔叔社會經驗太少

1388
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:43,773
You live here?

1389
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:47,523
All the furniture you see is included,
so you just need to move in...

1390
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,000
請喝咖啡吧

1391
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,503
When did you get home, Uncle Shin?

1392
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,410
還沒收錢呢

1393
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,610
院子裡有輛新車

1394
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,583
- Explain.
- The thing is...

1395
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,850
那是他的車

1396
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,693
this house is going to sit vacant
for like 20 years.

1397
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,910
不是我的車

1398
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,450
錢也已經...

1399
01:12:56,693 --> 01:13:02,543
I thought about the money we could make
by charging someone monthly rent...

1400
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,450
給完了

1401
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,720
事已至此 錢我會如數奉還 出去吧

1402
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:05,073
Do you even know what that is?
That thing over there is...

1403
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,820
事已至此

1404
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:07,243
Don't refer to our new tenant as "that"!

1405
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,890
合同書上都蓋完章...

1406
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,983
He owns tea houses.

1407
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:13,693
I'm sorry, I apologize.
My uncle is socially awkward.

1408
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:15,633
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

1409
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,330
希望不是重要的文件

1410
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,540
剛才那是複印的

1411
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,470
正本在房地產公司 行李明天會搬進來

1412
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:22,653
- He hasn't paid yet.
- I saw the new car out front.

1413
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,110
因為是良辰吉日

1414
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,740
喝完就走

1415
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,143
- It's the new tenant's car.
- It's not my car.

1416
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,040
我的寬宏大量僅限一杯咖啡

1417
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,310
你還是進去打包行李吧

1418
01:13:25,143 --> 01:13:26,903
And I've already given all my money...

1419
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,450
20年的行李 夠你忙一陣子的

1420
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,003
to him.

1421
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:32,350
想看到鬼怪發怒的面孔 是嗎

1422
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,053
Then I'll give you your money back,
so leave.

1423
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,420
你應該很清楚與使者之間的契約是什麼

1424
01:13:33,053 --> 01:13:38,353
I know you'd give me my money back,
but I've already signed the papers.

1425
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,920
<i>-=注: 跟死神的契約那種意思=-</i>

1426
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,920
不要這房子 帶走剛剛出去的那個朋友

1427
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,690
沒辦法

1428
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:43,060
有很多空房間 用吧

1429
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,400
就當成自己家

1430
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:46,803
- I hope that wasn't very important.
- That was just a copy.

1431
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,630
是我家

1432
01:13:46,803 --> 01:13:48,823
The real estate agent has the original
and my stuff will be here tomorrow.

1433
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:51,340
想把鬼怪趕出棲身老巢 我佩服你的勇氣

1434
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:50,623
I don't have any plans tomorrow.

1435
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:54,323
If you're done with your coffee, leave.
My hospitality ends here.

1436
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:55,643
Go and pack your bags.

1437
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:57,833
If you're leaving for the next 20 years,
then you should start packing now.

1438
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,133
You really want to start with a goblin?

1439
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,773
I'm sure you're aware of what it means
to sign a contract with the grim reaper.

1440
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,513
How about I take that young boy
instead of this house, then?

1441
01:14:09,683 --> 01:14:12,573
Nothing else I can do.
Use one of the many empty rooms.

1442
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,890
還真是野蠻

1443
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,190
如傳聞中一樣 是個低俗的組織

1444
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,523
- Make yourself at home.
- It is my home.

1445
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:15,623
No, it's my house.

1446
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:20,563
If you think you can kick a goblin out of
his own turf, then give it your best try.

1447
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:28,540
喔 手滑了 本來要好好扔給你的

1448
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:33,980
啊

1449
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,610
我也是手滑了

1450
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,680
本來是扔你身上的

1451
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:41,133
This is not the nice dinner
I had envisioned for myself.

1452
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:39,950
你

1453
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,220
剛才不是定了怎麼稱呼的嗎

1454
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:44,313
It's like a horrible restaurant that
I've only heard rumors about.

1455
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,590
這個 那個

1456
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,860
喂 你

1457
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,403
My bad.

1458
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:57,353
I was trying to get my soup.

1459
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:05,253
My bad this time.

1460
01:15:06,163 --> 01:15:08,513
I was trying to get you.

1461
01:15:08,513 --> 01:15:11,553
- "You"?
- I thought we had settled that earlier.

1462
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,673
This. That. Hey. You.

1463
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,050
戀人

1464
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,830
切

1465
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,800
戀人個鬼

您好

1472
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:54,803
Lovers... what a joke.

1473
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,030
非常開朗樂觀

1474
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:56,560
開朗樂觀

1475
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,460
再苦再累 只要叫我做 我都能做

1476
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,670

Hello.

1480

My name is Ji Eun Tak.

1483
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:25,903
I have a very upbeat
and positive attitude

1484
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:28,973
so I can do any and every type of work
you can ask of me with a smile!

1485
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:30,843
No matter how dirty the job...

1486
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,070
說什麼能找到兼職 狗屁

1487
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,340
守護神

1488
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,000
這人真是

1489
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,170
留了電話號碼就好了

1490
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,890
瞧瞧 是你沒錯

1491
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,560
嚇我一跳

1492
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:06,383
That was a load of crap
about me finding a job.

1493
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,760
你為什麼總跟著我

1494
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,470
我可沒有跟著你 是你召喚我的

1495
01:17:06,383 --> 01:17:09,063
A guardian angel?
What a liar.

1496
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:08,630
才不是呢

1497
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:11,370
我若有那個本事 就不用這麼苦了

1498
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:12,203
I should've at least gotten his number.

1499
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,570
我有什麼能耐啊

1500
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:14,070
搖鈴鐺召喚你嗎

1501
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:15,110
你問我 我問誰啊

1502
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,370
誰讓你一直頂嘴啊

1503
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,410
我才沒召喚你呢

1504
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:19,510
話又說回來

1505
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,580
你真的是守護神嗎

1506
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,050
是哪一類的

1507
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,580

你

1516
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:29,613
- See? It was you.
- Oh my goodness.

1517
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:33,620
叔叔你說的雞肉店 難道是養雞場嗎

1518
01:17:33,513 --> 01:17:35,203
Why do you keep following me around?

1519
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,190
在養雞場打工

1520
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,560
-不是
-那麼是哪裡

1521
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:38,003
- I didn't follow you. You summoned me.
- No, I didn't.

1522
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,800
說得好像真有那麼回事兒似的
叫人白抱希望了

1523
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:40,773
If I had the power to do that,
I wouldn't be suffering like this.

1524
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,330
你真不知道自己對我做了什麼...

1525
01:17:40,773 --> 01:17:43,333
How would I do that?
By shaking a bell or something?

1526
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,170
不是我

1527
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,300
我沒有召喚你

1528
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:47,853
- Why would you ask me?
- Because you keep arguing with me.

1529
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,900
是你 我說是你 是你沒錯

1530
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,840
從未有過這種情況

1531
01:17:47,853 --> 01:17:50,773
Anyway, are you sure
you're a guardian angel?

1532
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,440
真的是我嗎

1533
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:52,123
What kind of angel
are you, though?

1534
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,180
真的嗎

1535
01:17:52,623 --> 01:17:54,733
One that's been disgraced?
One that's on probation?

1536
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:57,323
One that's new to the job?
Who are you?

1537
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,220
若是真的

1538
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,550
那我是什麼人啊

1539
01:17:59,023 --> 01:18:02,733
Is the part-time job at the chicken
restaurant you mentioned

1540
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,190
啊 我知道了

1541
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:04,433
actually a job on a chicken farm?

1542
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,020
是什麼人

1543
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,123
- No, it's not.
- Where is it then?

1544
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,020
在我身上看到了什麼 全部說說看

1545
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:08,823
You gave me high hopes
as if it'd actually happen!

1546
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:11,733
- You really don't know what...
- No.

1547
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,500
穿了校服

1548
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,030
還有

1549
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:13,233
Like I said, I didn't summon you.

1550
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,000
很漂亮

1551
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:14,733
It was you! It was!
It definitely was!

1552
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,623
I've never had anything like
this happen to me before.

1553
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,640
那件校服

1554
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:20,523
Was it really me?

1555
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,970
就這些嗎

1556
01:18:21,733 --> 01:18:22,823
Really?

1557
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:26,210
沒看到翅膀什麼的嗎

1558
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:29,323
If it really was me, then...
what am I, exactly?

1559
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,980
依我看啊 我是精靈

1560
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,580
小叮噹

1561
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:32,123
Oh, I think I know now.

1562
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:33,433
What is it?

1563
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,123
Tell me everything that
you can see about me.

1564
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,590
不就是開了點玩笑嗎

1565
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:39,623
You have a school uniform on.

1566
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,390
啊

1567
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:40,733
What else?

1568
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,760
電話號碼

1569
01:18:42,303 --> 01:18:43,523
You're pretty.

1570
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:48,530
奉聖父聖子聖靈的名 阿門

1571
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,023
I mean, your uniform is.

1572
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,270
我們禱告

1573
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:50,533
Is that all?

1574
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,610
感謝天父施恩於我們

1575
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:55,123
You don't see anything else about me?

1576
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,310
但願離您更近一步

1577
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:59,323
I really must be a fairy
or something, like Tinker Bell.

1578
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:01,680
您以慈悲恩待我

1579
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:08,623
Geez, he can't even take a joke?

1580
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:11,523
Oh yeah, his phone number!
Damn it!

1581
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:17,433
In the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, amen.

1582
01:19:17,433 --> 01:19:19,123
Let us pray.

1583
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:23,123
We thank you, oh Lord, for
blessing us all so much.

1584
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:26,300
我知道了 知道怎麼召喚你了

1585
01:19:23,623 --> 01:19:28,623
Everything we do is for You, Lord,
so please give us strength.

1586
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,510
那也不能在這裡召喚我出來啊

1587
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,750
你怕了嗎

1588
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,580
聽說這位神很不錯呢

1589
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,350
不要奉承 你不是不相信有神嗎

1590
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,820
或許會在這兒呢 所以過來看看

1591
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,990
為什麼不一下子消失 走著去啊

1592
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,130
在這裡不行

1593
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:52,660
這裡類似非軍事區

1594
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:55,233
I got it! I figured out
how I can call you!

1595
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,130
不要跟著我

1596
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,070
我的願望 你打算怎麼辦

1597
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,040
三個當中有三個沒得到解決

1598
01:19:57,623 --> 01:20:00,023
But still, couldn't you have called
me to a better place than this?

1599
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,370
這次馬上就能解決了

1600
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,240
兼職也會

1601
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,670
不是那個 我是說男朋友

1602
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,840
那個需要你的努力

1603
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:04,933
Are you scared?

1604
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,813
I heard that Jesus and his
followers were good people.

1605
01:20:06,813 --> 01:20:08,463
Stop flattering them. Didn't you say
before that you didn't believe in them?

1606
01:20:08,463 --> 01:20:10,623
I came by just in case
they might be here.

1607
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,980
這樣對待我 你會後悔的

1608
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,850
我現在知道方法了

1609
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,950
算是拿到了電話號碼

1610
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:18,333
Why are you walking away instead of
disappearing with sparks and such?

1611
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:19,433
I can't do that here.

1612
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,933
Think of this as being
a kind of a dead zone for me.

1613
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:23,633
And don't follow me.

1614
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:26,233
What are you planning to
do about my wish?

1615
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,400
我以為這個不行呢

1616
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,633
None of the three things
that I wished for were taken care of.

1617
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
以為不行 為什麼還試

1618
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:30,333
They'll be taken care of soon.
Same goes for your job.

1619
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,033
No, not that. I mean the thing
about me getting a boyfriend.

1620
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,240
等一等

1621
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,433
You'll have to try hard
to make that happen too!

1622
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:41,133
You can't just leave things like this!

1623
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:46,033
I know how to summon him now.
I've got it now.

1624
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,680
你抓住我了嗎

1625
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:47,890
啊 實在不行了

1626
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:49,320
好燙啊

1627
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,220
我看是藍色的 以為涼呢

1628
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,630
本來就是藍色火焰溫度更高 你這個文科生

1629
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,333
Oh, I didn't think that
this would work.

1630
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,360
有空玩耍 不如多學習

1631
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,533
Why did you do it, then?

1632
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,330
對哦

1633
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:01,933
Wait!

1634
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:04,400
我自幼父母雙亡 無依無靠也一直拿第一名...

1635
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,700
算了

1636
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,640
不要做什麼守護神

1637
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,510
能不能給我500萬 把我打發掉

1638
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,510
我有事得走了

1639
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:13,010
什麼事

1640
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,933
Did you just latch onto me?

1641
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,380
打扮有些嚴肅哦

1642
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:17,450
明天是我認識的人的忌日

1643
01:21:15,933 --> 01:21:18,333
Oh, I can't hold on
much longer! That's hot!

1644
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:18,750
那你怎麼今天就去啊

1645
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,680
是外地嗎

1646
01:21:19,133 --> 01:21:21,333
I thought you'd be cold
since you were blue.

1647
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,820
那個地方 今天是明天

1648
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,290
那你什麼時候回來

1649
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,033
Don't you know that blue fire
is the hottest kind of fire?

1650
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:24,720
明天 後天

1651
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,090
我有話問你呢

1652
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:27,633
Why not study if you have
time to fool around like this?

1653
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,860
那快問吧

1654
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:33,333
You know, I've always been
at the top of my classes...

1655
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,870
我知道我這麼問 你會覺得很荒唐

1656
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,533
Oh, whatever.

1657
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,870
但請你不要誤會 認真聆聽

1658
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:37,833
Can't you just give me money
instead of being a guardian angel

1659
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,300
知道了 問吧 想問什麼

1660
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,170
一開始 我以為你是地獄使者

1661
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:38,833
and call it a day?

1662
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,633
I have to go because I'm busy.

1663
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:44,140
但若是地獄使者 一見到我肯定會帶我走

1664
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,033
What's got you so busy?

1665
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:44,933
Well, your outfit is
a bit fancy, yes.

1666
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,710
然後 我以為你是鬼

1667
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:46,633
Tomorrow's the death anniversary
of someone that I knew.

1668
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:48,333
So why are you heading
over there today?

1669
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:49,480
可是叔叔你

1670
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,333
Is that person's grave
out in the countryside?

1671
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,633
In that place,
today is tomorrow.

1672
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,580
有影子

1673
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:54,033
When are you coming back?
Tomorrow? The day after that?

1674
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,950
所以 我想了想

1675
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:55,533
There's something
I really want to ask!

1676
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,120
那位叔叔到底是什麼呢

1677
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:57,233
Hurry up and ask, then!

1678
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,660
那你說我是什麼

1679
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,320
鬼怪

1680
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,633
I know that this is
a strange question, but

1681
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,830
叔叔 你是不是鬼怪啊

1682
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:05,033
I'd like for you to not
misunderstand and hear me out.

1683
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,633
All right, already,
so ask away. What?

1684
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:09,333
When you first showed up,
I thought you may be a god of death.

1685
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,640
你是什麼人

1686
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:13,133
But you would have taken me away
as soon as you saw me if you were.

1687
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,370
你到底是什麼人

1688
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,940
不好意思自己開口

1689
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:16,733
And then, I thought that
you may just be a ghost.

1690
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,540
我是鬼怪新娘

1691
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:20,733
But you have a shadow.

1692
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,840
你知道我能看見鬼吧

1693
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,910
我一出生

1694
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:26,733
So I thought long and hard
about what you might be.

1695
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,750
身上就有這個

1696
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,890
可能是因為這個吧 所以那幫鬼

1697
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,033
And? What's your conclusion?
What am I?

1698
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,620
都叫我是鬼怪新娘

1699
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,533
A goblin.

1700
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,420
看見了吧

1701
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,533
Are you a goblin, by any chance?

1702
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,833
Who are you?
Who are you, really?

1703
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:43,133
It feels a bit awkward
for me to say, but...

1704
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,233
I'm the Goblin's Bride.

1705
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,510
這個

1706
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:48,733
You know that I can see spirits, right?

1707
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:51,133
I had this on me...

1708
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,680
證明一下吧

1709
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:54,833
since I was born.

1710
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:58,933
I think it's because of this that ghosts
keep saying that I'm the Goblin's Bride.

1711
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,110
讓我證明自己是鬼怪新娘啊

1712
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,450
是的

1713
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:00,633
You can see it, right?

1714
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,620
怎麼證明

1715
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,320
讓我 飛給你看看嗎

1716
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,133
Right here.

1717
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,260
或者

1718
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,190
變成掃把嗎

1719
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,730
能做就做

1720
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,190
我是認真的

1721
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,800
我也是

1722
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,460
在我身上看到什麼 你都說說看

1723
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,830
你這是報復我呀

1724
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:17,000
說說看 你都看到了什麼

1725
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:17,733
You can see it, right?

1726
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:22,133
Prove it to me.

1727
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,010
個子很高

1728
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,480
還有呢

1729
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:26,233
You want me to prove that
I'm the Goblin's Bride?

1730
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,510
衣服看起來很貴

1731
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:27,433
Yeah.

1732
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,850
還有呢

1733
01:23:28,433 --> 01:23:29,733
How do I do that?

1734
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:32,833
Do you want me to fly or something?

1735
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,780
大概是30歲中旬

1736
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,250
還有呢

1737
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,033
Or turn into a broomstick?

1738
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,790
該不會是想讓我說你帥吧

1739
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,033
Do it.

1740
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:38,633
I'm being really serious right now.

1741
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:39,833
Me too.

1742
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:41,960
我想要的答案 你應該知道

1743
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,833
Tell me what you see
when you look at me.

1744
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,333
Are you trying to get revenge on me?

1745
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:45,460
如果你在我身上看到的就只有那些的話

1746
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,033
Tell me, already!
Tell me everything you see!

1747
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,730
那你不是鬼怪新娘

1748
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:50,670
你對鬼怪沒有效用價值

1749
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,500
能看見鬼 雖然很不幸

1750
01:23:50,733 --> 01:23:52,233
You're tall.

1751
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:53,333
And?

1752
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,740
但你撿了一條命 還是感恩吧

1753
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:56,833
- Your clothes look expensive.
- And?

1754
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,680
你只是我違背原則 插手人類的生死問題

1755
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,510
出現的副作用而已

1756
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:01,933
You look like you're in
your mid-thirties.

1757
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:03,133
And?

1758
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:08,333
You don't want me to tell you that
you're handsome or something, right?

1759
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,950
如果我不願意接受呢

1760
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,320
那就照你原來的命 去死也可以

1761
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,033
You needed to have
the answer that I want.

1762
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,890
這話說的...

1763
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:17,063
But if that's all you can see,
you're not the Goblin's Bride.

1764
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:17,030
我知道了

1765
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:18,760
我再問剛才那個問題

1766
01:24:17,063 --> 01:24:19,033
You'd be of no use
to a goblin like this.

1767
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,870
叔叔你是不是

1768
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:21,633
I'm sorry that you see ghosts

1769
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,370
鬼怪啊

1770
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:24,633
but you're not supposed to
be alive anyway, so be thankful.

1771
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:23,570
-不是
-不是啊

1772
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:24,140
不是

1773
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,940
那麼是什麼

1774
01:24:24,633 --> 01:24:29,433
You've already broken the rules
just by existing as a human being.

1775
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,070
到底是什麼 敢判斷我的價值

1776
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,310
不是說處境變好一丁點也行嗎

1777
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:36,333
What if I don't want to be thankful?

1778
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:38,450
對你可憐的處境 擔心那麼一丁點的人

1779
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,633
Then you can just die
like you were supposed to.

1780
01:24:39,133 --> 01:24:40,433
You're so cruel.

1781
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:42,890
面對現實吧

1782
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,160
不要聽信傳聞

1783
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,933
Fine, then.

1784
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,760
因為你不是鬼怪新娘

1785
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:48,233
Let me ask you the same
thing I asked, one more time.

1786
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:51,933
Are you, by any chance, a goblin?

1787
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:52,933
- No.
- You're not?

1788
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,833
- I'm not.
- What are you, then?

1789
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,400
等一等

1790
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:59,233
Who are you to decide whether
you'll be with me or not?

1791
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:01,333
I thought you wanted your life
to change for the better.

1792
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,370
我還沒說完呢

1793
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:07,433
I'm just someone who cares just
a little bit about your crappy life.

1794
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:13,833
Tune into reality instead of letting
yourself be consumed by rumors.

1795
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,320
你這是

1796
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,850
從正門進來的嗎 跟著我

1797
01:25:14,433 --> 01:25:16,433
Because you're not the Goblin's Bride.

1798
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,360
你是怎麼進來的

1799
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,860
抓住門把手

1800
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,930
然後推

1801
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,830
跟著叔叔...

1802
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,333
Wait!

1803
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,570
這裡怎麼這個樣子

1804
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,740
所以我不是在問你嗎 你是怎麼通過正門的

1805
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:31,433
I'm not finished talking...

1806
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:34,770
啊 是坡州嗎 英語村那裡

1807
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,510
不過 就算是那裡也不對啊

1808
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,180
這裡到底...怎麼回事啊

1809
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,810
這裡到底是哪兒啊

1810
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,010
加拿大

1811
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:44,033
Did you just follow me
through that door?

1812
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,180
加拿大啊

1813
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,350
加拿大的話

1814
01:25:44,433 --> 01:25:47,233
How... did you do that?

1815
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,720
那個

1816
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,190
楓葉國

1817
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:50,620
北極光那裡嗎

1818
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,133
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed.

1819
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,520
這裡...這裡真的是外國嗎

1820
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:53,833
And then I followed you, Mister...

1821
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,033
But what's with this place?

1822
01:25:57,033 --> 01:25:59,933
Hey, I just asked you a question.
How did you come through that door?

1823
01:25:59,933 --> 01:26:03,133
Oh, is this
Provence Village in Paju?

1824
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:04,340
大發 叔叔 你還有這種本事啊

1825
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,933
But still, this doesn't
seem quite right.

1826
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,770
你也有啊

1827
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,470
你到底是什麼人

1828
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:09,033
What's going on here?
Where is this place?

1829
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,910
若這裡真的是加拿大 叔叔有這個本事

1830
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:10,333
Canada.

1831
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,633
Canada?

1832
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,850
那我決定了

1833
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:15,033
Canada...

1834
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,750
-決定什麼
-拿定主意了

1835
01:26:15,533 --> 01:26:18,233
You mean, the place
with the maple leaf?

1836
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:17,620
什...什麼

1837
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,550
我要嫁給你

1838
01:26:18,233 --> 01:26:19,833
The one in North America?

1839
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,620
我總覺得 你肯定是鬼怪沒錯

1840
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:22,033
Is this really a different country?

1841
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,490
我愛你

1842
01:26:29,933 --> 01:26:33,233
Wow. You can do this too?

1843
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,433
You apparently can too.
Who are you, really?

1844
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:41,133
If this really is Canada and
you really have the power to do this...

1845
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,633
I've made up my mind.

1846
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,233
- About what?
- I've made up my mind!

1847
01:26:46,233 --> 01:26:47,233
So, about what, exactly?

1848
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:48,633
I'll marry you, Mister!

1849
01:26:48,633 --> 01:26:52,233
Because no matter how I think about it,
I'm pretty sure that you're a goblin.

1850
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:54,633
I love you!
