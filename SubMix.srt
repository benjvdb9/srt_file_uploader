00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:02,633
<i>If a spirit inhabits an object that has
the touch or the blood of a human on it</i>

5
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,433
<i>若靈魂附在某人的舊物</i>

6
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,733
<i>或沾了血的物件上</i>

7
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,932
<i>the spirit becomes a goblin.</i>

8
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:05,173
<i>便會成為鬼怪</i>

9
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:16,753
<i>上過無數戰場 染過鮮血的長劍</i>

10
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,932
<i>And this was a sword
from a battlefield</i>

11
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:16,843
<i>with the blood of thousands on it</i>

12
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:21,383
<i>沾染上了主人的血更甚</i>

13
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,022
<i>with even its own owner's blood on
it, so it was only to be expected.</i>

14
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>And only the bride of the goblin will
be able to pull out that sword.</i>

15
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:42,843
<i>唯有鬼怪的新娘 才可拔出此劍</i>

16
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,503
<i>And when the sword is pulled out</i>

17
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:47,882
<i>拔出劍之後 一切歸於無 便可安息</i>

18
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:48,323
<i>he will become nothing
once more, and rest in peace.</i>

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,322
Of course, this is a cruel
deal for the goblin.

20
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:02,163
<i>這是惡毒的神諭</i>

21
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,832
<i>而以不死之身重生的鬼怪</i>

22
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:05,823
The goblin, which woke up
to realize that it is immortal

23
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,532
is everywhere and nowhere in
this world at the same time

24
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:09,362
<i>在這世上亦有亦無</i>

25
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,433
<i>此刻也在某...</i>

26
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,423
and even now, nobody
knows where he may be...

27
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,632
Why the hell are you laughing, girl?

28
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:16,773
笑什麼 死丫頭

29
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:23,422
Are you about to tell me, "He's still
looking for his bride, and it's me"?

30
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,283
此刻 也可能在某處尋找著新娘

31
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,052
<b>-=第1集=-</b>

32
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:22,012
而那個新娘... 就是我

33
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:23,582
你是想這麼說的嗎

34
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,422
Even though I look like this now, I had
hordes of men following me in my prime!

35
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,082
別看我現在這樣

36
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,853
年輕時可是俘獲了不少男人的心

37
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,393
下次來時若我不在了 你可別吃驚

38
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:32,423
Don't come back next time
only to be surprised to find me gone.

39
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:34,392
真是羨慕啊

40
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,923
Wow, I'm so jealous.

41
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,392
我真是老糊塗了

42
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,423
I'm just getting old.

43
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,532
跟你這個未婚媽媽炫耀這些

44
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,232
That's not something for me to
brag about in front of you, though.

45
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,823
Hey, that's not nice!

46
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,733
真壞

47
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,702
菠菜 白菜都給你算便宜了

48
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:47,533
No, I'm not! I give you discounts
on spinach and cabbage!

49
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:47,872
我還壞

50
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:51,343
是拋棄你的那個混蛋才是壞

51
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,033
The bastard who left you behind
and ran off is the not nice one here.

52
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,732
You do have a point.

53
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,983
那倒是

54
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,033
But you know, that story is too sad.

55
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,452
不過這個故事好傷感

56
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:00,222
有何傷感的

57
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,323
Ha, sure.

58
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,983
是一個浪漫而怨毒的詛咒

59
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:03,123
It's really a romantic sort of curse.

60
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,722
為求死而尋找新娘

61
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,923
I mean, he has to find
his bride in order to die.

62
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:08,893
神真壞

63
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,132
God is cruel.

64
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,393
神原本就不是好惹的

65
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,423
God has always been cruel.

66
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,533
自私 善妒

67
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,532
And he's selfish and jealous too.

68
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,533
God only cares about himself.

69
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,872
唯我獨尊

70
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,132
He's just like another
guy we know, huh?

71
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:21,372
和某人真像

72
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:25,132
Well, I'll be going now.
I hope you sell a lot.

73
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,173
我走了 祝您生意興隆

74
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:28,233
And you'd better be
here next time too, okay?

75
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:28,883
下次來 您也一定要在哦

76
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,852
危在旦夕時

77
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:37,033
When you're in a position in which
your life is flashing before your eyes

78
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:42,292
你要虔誠禱告

79
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,923
pray for mercy
with all your heart.

80
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:45,732
<i>Because a god with a soft spot
may be listening to you.</i>

81
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,132
<i>-=1968年巴黎=-</i>

82
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,733
可能某位好心的神

83
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,602
會聽到你的禱告

84
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,323
<i>[PARIS, 1968]</i>

85
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,533
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

86
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,753
換做是我 不會這麼做

87
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,032
If you run away from home now, you'll
live with worse people than that.

88
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:06,582
你若現在離開家

89
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:08,823
就會過上比現在更糟糕的生活

90
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,222
可能會再也見不到你媽媽

91
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,233
And you'll never see
your mother again.

92
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,552
你是誰

93
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,122
Who the hell are you?
Are you Korean?

94
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,353
韓國人嗎

95
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,032
I'm a more complicated person
than you'd think.

96
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,063
一言難盡

97
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:15,733
It's your turn now.

98
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,893
現在該你了

99
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:19,362
逐字逐句地說清楚

100
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,332
Go and tell him clearly

101
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:23,733
"You've adopted me, so you're my father.
So you have to raise me well."

102
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:20,103
告訴他 既然領養了我

103
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,732
你就是我的父親

104
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:23,503
所以 你該好好撫養我

105
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,173
去告訴你媽媽 讓她幫你

106
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,832
And ask your mother for help too.
And tell her you're in pain.

107
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:26,872
告訴她你的痛苦

108
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,123
What kind of bull are you spouting?
Get the hell out of my way!

109
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:28,243
你在胡說八道什麼

110
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:29,003
讓開

111
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:33,443
提醒你一句 那樣割脈只能廢了手臂卻死不了

112
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,332
And slitting your wrist like
that won't kill you

113
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,832
but it'll render your hand
useless, so be aware of that.

114
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:34,332
Who are you?

115
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:34,283
你是誰

116
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,282
看著他 逐字逐句地說

117
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,122
Don't avoid his gaze
and speak clearly.

118
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,423
Can you do that?

119
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,612
能做到嗎？

120
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:41,232
And what if he beats me to death?
Will you take responsibility?

121
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,352
要是被打死了怎麼辦

122
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,882
你負責嗎？

123
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,753
所以我先幫你弄斷了他的類肋骨

124
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,832
That's why I broke his rib for you.

125
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,022
你個混蛋...

126
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,732
You little bastard!

127
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,603
這是便當

128
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:53,622
That's lunch for you.

129
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:54,733
等談完了上學去

130
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:54,832
Go to school
after you're done talking to him.

131
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,103
第17道數學題答案不是2 而是4

132
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,232
The answer for number 17
on the math quiz isn't 2. It's 4.

133
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,332
那道題不能錯

134
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,533
You got that question wrong, so...

135
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,843
你到底是誰

136
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,833
Who... are you, really?

137
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:21,622
他是水 是火 是風

138
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:20,922
<i>He's water, wind, and fire.</i>

139
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,862
是光明 是黑暗

140
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,623
<i>Light and darkness.</i>

141
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:27,003
也曾是...

142
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,832
<i>And at one time...</i>

143
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,122
<i>he was human.</i>

144
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:36,072
人類

145
00:05:49,146 --> 00:06:01,147


146
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:06,273
百姓稱他為神

147
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,033
<i>His subjects called him "God."</i>

148
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:17,123
<i>He cut down his foes
covered in crimson blood</i>.

149
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:15,582
闖過血雨腥風 殺敵無數

150
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:22,123
<i>And he was a military man
through and through.</i>

151
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:22,082
當得起武神二字

152
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:33,382
金信將軍萬歲...

153
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:35,122
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

154
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,223
萬歲...

155
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:43,832
- Hooray for the general!
- Hooray for the general!

156
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,622
金信將軍萬歲...

157
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:43,933
將軍萬歲...

158
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:48,832
萬歲...

159
00:08:54,932 --> 00:09:00,433
Step aside! It's the great
General Kim Shin!

160
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,643
打開城門

161
00:08:56,643 --> 00:09:00,443
金信將軍 凱旋

162
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,123
Kim Shin will take off his armor
and heed the king's royal decree.

163
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:03,783
金信卸下戎裝

164
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,522
I dare you to say
that again, punk!

165
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,283
大膽 竟敢出言不遜

166
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,353
正七品別將竟敢對上將軍...

167
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,622
How dare some political
lackey like you oppose...

168
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:15,963
明君的叛臣金信 卸下戎裝

169
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:16,123
The criminal Kim Shin will
take off his armor and...

170
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,633
你竟敢...

171
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,623
How dare you!

172
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,533
好

173
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,022
I heard you loud and clear.
Wait there.

174
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,703
等著

175
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,732
Happy now?

176
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,112
可以了吧

177
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,812
逆臣金信

178
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,732
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees

179
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,522
棄劍 跪下領旨

180
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:41,932
and heed the king's royal decree.

181
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,522
我非割下你的舌頭...

182
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,332
I'll pull that rotten tongue
of yours right out!

183
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,732
"Criminal Kim Shin"?
Are you out of your damn mind?

184
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:46,393
何來的逆臣 瘋了不成

185
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,463
失心瘋了嗎你們

186
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,122
Are you insane?

187
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,622
General.

188
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:58,272
將軍

189
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,832
逆臣 金信

190
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:02,333
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees...

191
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,143
棄劍跪下...

192
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,683
本將軍要見殿下 讓開

193
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:08,122
I'm going to see the king.
Get out of my way.

194
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:11,932
- Criminal Kim Shin...
- If you don't move, you'll surely die.

195
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:09,612
罪臣金信...

196
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:12,353
擋我者死

197
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,733
Step aside.

198
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,353
讓開

199
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,232
救命啊

200
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,503
救命啊

201
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,973
你們這幫傢夥

202
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,832
You bastards!

203
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:41,732
These men fought
for three straight nights!

204
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:41,513
我們以主君之名已戰了3天3夜

205
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:44,813
好不容易才從人間地獄活著回來

206
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,523
They were just on their way
back from that hell!

207
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:49,122
So how dare you...
how dare you bastards!

208
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:49,123
可是你們... 你們竟然...

209
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:52,332
Open the castle gates!

210
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:52,093
打開城門

211
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,933
Stay here and watch over the men.

212
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,733
守在他們身邊

213
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,603
我去去就來

214
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,932
I'll be right back.

215
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:42,332
They say that he's like a king among
the people and regarded as a god.

216
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,602
百姓之上是王

217
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,442
王之上是神

218
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:45,143
據說那神就是指金信

219
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,832
And his name is Kim Shin.

220
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,522
他打了無數勝仗 蠱惑了百姓

221
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:55,832
<i>That man's endless ascension to power
is making the citizens rise up</i>

222
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:59,022
他的權勢再三嘲弄王室

223
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:59,332
<i>and his power makes a mockery
of the royal family's authority.</i>

224
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:03,663
請以國法嚴加懲處

225
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:03,733
So please, issue him the harshest
punishment you can under the law.

226
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,433
他

227
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,522
<i>He was able to see the blades
of his opponents quite well</i>

228
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,933
雖能看清敵人的刀刃

229
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:15,243
但沒能看出年輕君王對自己的嫉妒和恐懼

230
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>but he'd been blind to the young
king's fear and jealousy toward him.</i>

231
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:24,283
那是 指向自己的最鋒利的刀刃

232
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,522
<i>And he was unaware of the fact</i>

233
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:28,832
<i>that the king's jealousy and fear were
sharper than any blade he'd known.</i>

234
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:28,582
可惜他沒能看清

235
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:38,023
So he's really going this far?

236
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,763
真要做到如此地步嗎

237
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:39,532
所以不要再過來

238
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,832
Don't step any closer.

239
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,032
停下

240
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,122
Stop right there.

241
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:44,032
不管你有什麼理由 都停下

242
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:44,023
Stop all of it.

243
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:48,732
Stop right there and die.
If you do, I'll spare everyone else.

244
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,333
停在那裡 死於逆賊之名吧

245
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,542
那麼除了你之外 可以放過所有人

246
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:51,742
但是 如果再往前走一步

247
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:51,832
But if you take even one
more step toward me

248
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,612
你每邁出一步 每一個眼神

249
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:56,932
I'll kill everyone in front of you
and lay their corpses at your feet.

250
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:57,283
我都會殺了所有人鋪在你的腳下

251
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:02,082
向前走吧 將軍

252
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,833
Go, General.

253
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:09,493
我沒關係

254
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:09,432
I'm all right.

255
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:12,862
我...

256
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,022
I...

257
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,703
王妃娘娘 我...

258
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:15,932
Your Highness, I...

259
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,402
我知道

260
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,233
I know.

261
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,603
我真的全都知道

262
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,522
I know everything.

263
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:26,832
And if this is the end for me,
then such is my fate.

264
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,313
如果這就是我的結局

265
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:27,482
那麼這也是我的命運

266
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,713
所以你往前走吧

267
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:30,022
So please, go.

268
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:31,412
不要停下

269
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:33,932
Don't stop, and keep
walking toward the king.

270
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,183
去殿下那兒 將軍

271
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:55,957


272
00:13:57,122 --> 00:14:00,733
Don't spare her
or anyone related to her!

273
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,172
你這是謀反

274
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:02,082
滿門抄斬 一個不留 這是禦命

275
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,233
This is my command!

276
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,622
Stop!

277
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,463
住手

278
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:58,033
還愣著幹什麼 讓罪人跪下

279
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:57,832
What are you doing?
Bring the criminal to his knees!

280
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,412
將軍

281
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:10,022
General!

282
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,332
Your Highness!
How could you do this?

283
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:17,122
殿下 您這是為何

284
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:19,893
就不怕天譴嗎

285
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,832
Have you no fear of the heavens?

286
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:23,022
It's not like the heavens
have ever taken your side.

287
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,393
老天什麼時候站在你們那邊了

288
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:27,362
罪人兇狠的眼神令禦心慌亂

289
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,733
Having that sinner's gaze
upon us is making me dizzy.

290
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,522
Strike him down now!

291
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:30,302
斬立決

292
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:41,112
這不關你事

293
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,732
This doesn't concern you.

294
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:44,852
將軍 將軍 將軍 將軍

295
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,932
General! General!

296
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:52,922
我想拜託你來結束我的性命

297
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:52,523
I want to make
a final request of you.

298
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,333
To think that such a day would come.

299
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,713
遵將軍之命

300
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:25,253
請您原諒

301
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,522
Forgive me, sir.

302
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,522
I'll be right behind you, sir.

303
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,633
小的隨後就來

304
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:56,022
任何人都不許替逆賊收屍

305
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,823
Nobody may retrieve
this criminal's body.

306
00:16:55,823 --> 00:17:00,733
Leave it out on the fields to be
consumed by wild animals!

307
00:16:56,022 --> 00:17:00,522
棄屍荒野任由猛禽野獸啃食

308
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:07,563
他也就值給禽獸果腹

309
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:07,522
Such is the only fitting punishment
for a criminal such as him.

310
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:11,432
This is a royal decree!

311
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,732
這是禦命

312
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,753
將軍 一路走好

313
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:04,522
- Please have mercy, God!
- Please, spare him!

314
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,452
將軍

315
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,453
我們的將軍

316
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:08,792
好可憐

317
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,893
我們的將軍好可憐...

318
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,902
將軍...

319
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,022
<i>Don't pray to anyone or anything.</i>

320
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:31,152
不要求任何人

321
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,523
<i>Because the gods aren't listening.</i>

322
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,223
神不會聽的

323
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:42,323
<i>And on that clear,
sunny afternoon...</i>

324
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:41,722
一日之中陽光最明媚的午時

325
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,523
<i>he died by the very
blade that he'd wielded.</i>

326
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:48,262
他死於自己保護的主君的刀下

00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,353
這種瘋子

333
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,823
Are your eyes only there
for decoration?

334
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,692
長眼睛來喘氣的嗎

335
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,932
You have a death... wish...

336
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,732
找死...

337
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:28,432
Hey, what's with you, bastard?

338
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:27,862
你這小子

339
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,203
是什麼東西

340
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,523
A wild boar.

341
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,173
野豬

342
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,823
What?

343
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:40,882
什麼

344
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,523
You struck a wild boar
with your car.

345
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:48,422
你撞到了野豬

346
00:20:49,546 --> 00:21:01,546


347
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,932
Are you all right, sir?
Do you want me to call the authorities?

348
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:05,402
你沒事吧

349
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,003
要不要幫你報警

350
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:10,352
I just hit a wild boar, you see...

351
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:11,673
我撞到了野豬

352
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,073
so, um, a wild boar
came out of nowhere!

353
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,012
就是說...

354
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,042
野豬突然間竄出來

355
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,873
A wild boar?
In the middle of Gangnam?

356
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,853
野...野豬 在江南市中心

357
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:21,873
It's... it's a person!

358
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:23,152
那...那裡

359
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,672
Oh my gosh, what do we do?

360
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,573
Hello? This is 911, right?

361
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:27,762
喂 是119吧

362
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,373
I'm at the Yeoksang
four-way intersection.

363
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:29,662
這裡是驛三十字路口

364
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:31,073
There's a woman in the trunk of
a car here! I think she may be dead.

365
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:32,063
後備箱裡有個女人好像已經死了

366
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,173
I'm not sure.
She's not moving. Yes.

367
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:34,433
不知道 現在一動不動

368
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,673
I'm not sure about that. I just happened
to come across this car accident...

369
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:35,963
具體情況不知道

370
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,902
究竟是因為交通事故 還是...

371
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,372
I'm not sure what's going on.
You should hurry and come.

372
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:40,872
具體的不知道 請快點來看看

373
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:40,372
Yes.

374
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:42,503
我怎麼...

375
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,273
Why am I...
why am I there?

376
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:45,942
-這裡是驛三十字路口人行道
-我怎麼會在那裡

377
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,353
Hwang Mi Young.
25 years old.

378
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:48,512
黃美英 25歲

379
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:51,073
Born in the year of the ox
on March 1st.

380
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:52,283
癸醜年 丁巳月 乙巳日 辰時出生

381
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:55,872
Time of death is 08:32 on Friday.

382
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:57,323
戊寅年 乙卯月 己卯日 八時三十二分死亡

383
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:59,173
That's the information
I have on the deceased.

384
00:21:57,452 --> 00:22:00,522
死因 窒息致死

385
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,573
That's you, right?

386
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,633
是你本人吧

387
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:31,272
Drink it. It'll make you forget about
what happened to you in this life.

388
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:32,223
喝吧 會讓你忘掉今生的記憶

389
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:48,872
What happens if I don't drink this?

390
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,772
如果不喝

391
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,042
會怎樣

392
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,472
You'll come to regret it.

393
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,913
會後悔沒有喝下去

394
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:55,372
I hope that you will leave your
regrets behind with this life.

395
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,312
不管是什麼樣的後悔

396
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:56,683
願你都能留在今生

397
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,673
A goblin?

398
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,172
鬼怪

399
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,673
A god of death?

400
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,343
地獄使者

401
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,373
That's quite a vulgar
disguise he has on.

402
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,612
戴了一頂俗不可耐的帽子

403
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:57,573
Your Lordship!

404
00:24:57,272 --> 00:24:58,632
老爺

405
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,073
It's been 20 years
since I've last seen you.

406
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,383
二十年沒見了

407
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,673
Have you been well for
all those years, sir?

408
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,853
您別來無恙吧

409
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,573
Have you been well?

410
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,253
你也一切還安好吧

411
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:16,972
Well, I've aged quite a bit, sir.

412
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:18,823
我可是老了很多

413
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:21,073
But you're looking
as brilliant as ever.

414
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:22,423
老爺依然那麼帥氣

415
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,672
He doesn't look that cool to me.

416
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:26,732
沒感覺太帥啊

417
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,873
You punk!

418
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:28,862
混小子

419
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,873
This is my grandson.
The one that I've told you about.

420
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:33,132
微臣鬥膽向您介紹 這是微臣的孫子

421
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:33,372
Greet him properly.

422
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,303
問候一聲吧

423
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:36,073
Who is this guy?

424
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:36,883
<i>-=劉德華=-</i>

425
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,173
這位大叔是誰啊

426
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:38,173
So you're Duk Hwa.

427
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:39,112
你就是德華啊

428
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:43,872
I'm someone who'll be your uncle, your
brother, your son, then your grandson.

429
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:42,282
我會是你的叔叔 你的兄弟

430
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:44,952
繼而便將成為你的兒子 你的孫子

431
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,872
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

432
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,193
請多多關照咯

433
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:51,372
What does that even mean?

434
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:52,492
這什麼鬼

435
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:52,573
You seem weirder and weirder
by the minute, Mister.

436
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:53,963
真是越來越奇怪了

437
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,173
You brat!

438
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:55,593
混小子

439
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:57,472
Oh, I offer my deepest apologies, sir.

440
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:58,792
哎喲喂 微臣惶恐

441
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,573
He's an only child
and was quite spoiled, you see.

442
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:02,862
身為四代獨子 家裡一直嬌慣有加就...

443
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,173
But you...

444
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:08,302
不過你...

445
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,973
Me? What about me?

446
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:09,603
我

447
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,512
怎麼了

448
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:14,973
There was a boy who was born in this land
but was laid to rest in another country.

449
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,582
曾有個在高麗出生

450
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,813
後來長眠於異國的人

451
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,472
You're his descendant.

452
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,883
他是你遙遠的祖先

453
00:26:18,472 --> 00:26:20,172
And you look just like him.

454
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,622
你和那個孩子長得真像

455
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,772
Which part, exactly?

456
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,082
在哪兒啊

457
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:24,873
Was that ancestor of mine handsome?

458
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,493
那個祖先

459
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:25,993
他長得帥嗎

460
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,772
Duk Hwa!

461
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,122
混小子

462
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:31,873
I have no idea how such an insolent child
came to be. My apologies, Your Lordship.

463
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:31,092
微臣也不知從哪兒帶來了這樣的混小子

464
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:33,033
真是無顏以對了 老爺

465
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:36,372
Worry not.
You've never disappointed anyone.

466
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,633
無需介懷

467
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,202
你還從未讓人失望過

468
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:37,472
But you know, Uncle.

469
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,933
不過話說 叔叔

470
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,972
Why do you keep using
informal speech toward Grandpa?

471
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,673
你為什麼總對我爺爺用平語

472
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,173
Do you have a death wish
or something?

473
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:42,903
你找死啊

474
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,173
Why, you little!

475
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,343
混小子

476
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,673
Oh my...

477
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:46,013
哎喲

478
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,972
<i>Your Lordship.</i>

479
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:48,512
老爺

480
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:57,872
I offer my deepest apologies
for coming to see you so late.

481
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:58,992
小人來得太晚了 實在是抱歉

482
00:26:57,872 --> 00:27:03,972
I've been sick all this
time, Your Lordship.

483
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:05,463
小人要是早些知道...

484
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:13,772
I must feel the same way
that your blade does, sir.

485
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:11,732
我...這

486
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:14,972
氣數已盡

487
00:27:13,772 --> 00:27:22,373
From this moment on, this child
will serve you, Your Lordship.

488
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,342
從今日起

489
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:23,783
這個孩子 便會侍奉老爺

490
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,873
This is my grandson.

491
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:26,152
這是小人的孫子

492
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:29,373
This sword is "Your Lordship," Grandpa?

493
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:28,052
這把刀

494
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:30,923
就是老爺嗎 爺爺

495
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,972
<i>It seems that your subjects
have saved your soul.</i>

496
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:43,063
看來是你的百姓的靈魂救了你啊

497
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:51,573
<i>However, your blade
is stained with blood.</i>

498
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:49,573
然而

499
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:52,943
你的劍上沾滿了數千人的鮮血

500
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:58,673
<i>They may have been your enemies,
but they were the gods' creations.</i>

501
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,152
對你而言 他們雖是敵人

502
00:27:57,152 --> 00:28:00,183
可他們也同樣是神所創造之物

503
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:04,972
<i>So you will be immortal and alone,
watching your loved ones die before you.</i>

504
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,922
你會孑然一身 在永生不滅中輪迴

505
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:06,122
親眼看著心愛之人的死去

506
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:08,173
<i>Not a single one of those deaths
will be wiped from your memory.</i>

507
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:09,393
你便不會忘記任何的死亡

508
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:15,073
<i>This blessing is the punishment
that I am giving to you.</i>

509
00:28:11,362 --> 00:28:13,633
這既是我賜於你的獎賞

510
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,232
也是你所受到的懲罰

511
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:25,672
<i>And only the Goblin's Bride will be
able to remove that blade.</i>

512
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:27,012
唯有鬼怪新娘 方能拔出此劍

513
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:31,073
<i>And when she does, you'll be able to
return to nothingness and rest in peace.</i>

514
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,183
一旦拔出此劍

515
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:32,853
你便會化為虛無 得享安息

516
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:38,773
Your Lordship!

517
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:40,122
老爺

518
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:43,173
There is a place
where I must go.

519
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:44,663
我要去個地方

520
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,573
Who goes there?

521
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,483
放肆

522
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,472
How dare you come into
a place like this?

523
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:04,982
侍衛都是怎麼做事的
居然讓如此大不敬之人闖進來

524
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,472
Hey, you insolent...

525
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:08,622
你這傢夥 這裡好歹是...

526
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:17,573
Y-you... are...

527
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,393
你...

528
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:48,073
I was too late, it seems.

529
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:45,653
我...

530
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,522
來遲了

531
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:59,173
Grandpa! Grandpa!

532
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,402
爺爺

533
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:06,173
Grandpa!

534
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:07,442
爺爺

535
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:26,172
It seems...

536
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,262
看來你...

537
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:32,372
that this is the first punishment
that I am receiving.

538
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:33,773
便是我所受到的第一個懲罰

539
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:38,573
Please... accept me.

540
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:37,572
請您...

541
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:39,812
收下我吧

542
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:54,773
As of this moment,
I will serve you.

543
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:56,022
從今起 便由我來侍奉您

544
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,872
That was my grandfather's final wish.

545
00:30:56,292 --> 00:31:00,463
這是爺爺的遺言

546
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,173
I became blinded
by my desire for revenge...

547
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:03,672
一心為復仇 蒙蔽了雙眼

548
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:08,673
and couldn't even ask your
grandfather how he'd been.

549
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:07,143
要如何過下去

550
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:10,012
我連一句問候都還沒能說出

551
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:13,173
And yet...

552
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,612
即便如此

553
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,073
you wish to serve me?

554
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:18,383
你還是願意嗎

555
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:58,097


556
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:03,133
It's quite nice to be able to enjoy
a view like this at my leisure.

557
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:04,893
心無雜念地看著這樣的風景 真好

558
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,323
And I'm happy that you can enjoy
a view like this at your leisure.

559
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:08,933
我覺得你能這般心無雜念看著這樣的風景挺好

560
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:26,823
Here.

561
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:28,582
給

562
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:36,323
You should have it, Your Lordship.
I'm still quite full.

563
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:38,093
我肚子還很飽 老爺您吃吧

564
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,523
How is it that you're full
when you've had nothing to eat?

565
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,933
又沒有東西可吃 你怎麼會肚子飽呢

566
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,133
I'm tiny, so I get full even after
eating the tiniest morsel of food.

567
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:45,632
我還小 哪怕只要吃一點也會飽的

568
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,323
You're much bigger than I am, sir,
so please eat that instead.

569
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:49,073
老爺塊頭大 還是老爺您吃吧

570
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,523
We can do this, then.

571
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,042
那如此便是

572
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:53,932
We're still quite
far from land, sir.

573
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:55,983
離到陸地還遠著呢

574
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:57,823
Neither of us will be full
if we share this.

575
00:32:55,983 --> 00:32:59,713
要是分著吃 誰都填不飽肚子的

576
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,783
So is that why
you're insisting on starving?

577
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,022
所以 你要餓著肚子嗎

578
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:05,432
I'm a child, so I can go around
to beg for food if I get hungry.

579
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,692
我要實在餓了 會去船上幫忙幹活

580
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,292
只要稍微蹭點吃的便好

581
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:09,292
Do you think I brought you with me
just to have you go around begging?

582
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,493
你以為我帶你來 就為了讓你蹭口吃的嗎

583
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,932
Trust me.

584
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:12,232
相信我

585
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:14,723
I may be an even greater
person than you imagine.

586
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:16,433
也許我的強大遠遠超出了你的想像

587
00:33:16,022 --> 00:33:17,222
Come, now.

588
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:18,933
趕緊的

589
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,932
Wow!

590
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:40,722
Wow!

591
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:54,222
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!

592
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,972
老爺

593
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,172
老爺

594
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,722
Can I peek in that bag of yours?

595
00:33:57,373 --> 00:33:59,042
可以看看你的包袱嗎

596
00:33:57,722 --> 00:33:59,923
We need to decrease
the weight on this boat, you see.

597
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:01,283
得減掉他的重量呢

598
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,133
Your Lordship.
Your Lordship!

599
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:06,622
老爺

600
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,923
Put that child down now.

601
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:08,552
趕緊把孩子放下來

602
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:09,223
If you do, I'll let you keep
your life at the very least.

603
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:10,622
如此 我便饒你們一命

604
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:13,223
It's clear there's someone among us who's
at fault for the waves being unruly.

605
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:14,893
船上的風浪起得很怪異
任我怎麼看 裡面都有不吉利的人

606
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,422
I'll sell you as a slave,
so give me your hands and feet!

607
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:16,162
就是你小子

608
00:34:16,162 --> 00:34:18,893
我會將你小子賣去當奴隸 留他四肢健全

609
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,922
And as for this squirt,
throw him overboard.

610
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,832
把孩子扔下去

611
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,923
Do you know what happens to
humans who are lesser than animals?

612
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:39,583
你可知道人類若是連禽獸都不如 會如何

613
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,423
They meet the God of Wrath.

614
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:56,163
便會造就憤怒之神

615
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,423
H-h-he's a goblin!

616
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:11,353
鬼...鬼...是鬼怪

617
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,022
Please, spare us!

618
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:23,652
救救我

619
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:26,922
It's too late.

620
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,162
遲了

621
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:41,323
It sure is nice to be back
here at my leisure.

622
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:43,132
心無雜念 就這麼回來了真好

623
00:38:20,422 --> 00:38:24,922
Why? Why did you do that?

624
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:25,813
拜託 救救我吧

625
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:46,622
<i>If there is a god, please...</i>

626
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:47,802
如果有神 求您了

627
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:49,523
<i>please, save me.</i>

628
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,332
救救...我吧

629
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,232
<i>Please, save me.</i>

630
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,972
救救我吧

631
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,732
<i>Just anybody, please. Save me!</i>

632
00:38:58,343 --> 00:39:01,612
隨便哪位都好 求您了

633
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,622
Who are you?

634
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:34,013
救救我

635
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,122
I'm "just anybody."

636
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:38,852
我是隨便哪位

637
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:42,232
Please... please, help me.

638
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:44,593
求您了 求您救救我吧

639
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,423
Well, I don't know.

640
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:48,222
這個嘛

641
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,323
It's my rule not to get involved
in human beings' lives.

642
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:53,132
我的原則便是不干涉人類的生死

643
00:39:55,323 --> 00:40:01,733
I... really can't
just die like this.

644
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:58,402
我...

645
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:03,672
我...不能就這麼死了

646
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:09,233
The one you're asking me
to save isn't you, is it?

647
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,813
看來 你要我救的並不是你啊

648
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:22,463
求...孩...只要救下孩子便好

649
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,823
Just my child, at least. Please.

650
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:46,622
You're lucky, though, to have
met a soft-hearted god like me.

651
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,712
你今天很走運

652
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:48,522
遇到了如此心軟的神

653
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,923
It's just that I don't want
to see anyone die tonight.

654
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:52,522
今晚我不想見到有人死去

655
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,033
<i>[JI YEON HEE. 27 YEARS OLD. BORN IN
THE YEAR OF THE TIGER ON MARCH 1ST.]</i>

656
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:03,642
<i>[NO NAME. ZERO YEARS OLD.]</i>

657
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,922
Snow, and rain, and...

658
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,673
雪

659
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:18,542
和血

660
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,422
flowers, eh?

661
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:24,853
還有花

662
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:49,732
<i>- The Goblin's Bride is back.
- The Goblin's Bride is back.</i>

663
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:51,012
是鬼怪新娘

664
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,322
<i>[EIGHT YEARS LATER]</i>

<i>-=8年後=-</i>

666
00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:22,733
What do you want for your
birthday this year, Eun Tak?

667
00:43:21,003 --> 00:43:24,173
我們家恩卓 今年的生日想要什麼樣的年糕

668
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,623
Round rice cakes?
Square rice cakes?

669
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:25,073
甜年糕

670
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:26,643
彩虹年糕

671
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:30,623
Mom. Can't I have a party now
instead of Korean-style parties?

672
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:29,082
媽媽

673
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:32,283
我能不能不要開生日宴了 直接開個派對呢

674
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,922
What's the difference?

675
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,323
Well, a cake instead of
rice cakes, for one.

676
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:33,523
有什麼不一樣的啊

677
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:35,723
年糕蛋糕不一樣啊

678
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,923
I want to blow out candles
and make a wish too.

679
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:38,392
我也想要吹蠟燭許願呢

680
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,732
I think the reason why my
wish isn't coming true is because

681
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:42,022
總是對著年糕許願 總覺得根本不管用呢

682
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:40,423
I've been making my wishes on rice
cakes instead of birthday candles.

683
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:44,732
Oh, I didn't realize!

684
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,132
看來媽媽沒給你準備生日蛋糕啊

685
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:47,122
I only got you rice cakes
because you like them!

686
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:49,062
媽媽是看你喜歡吃年糕 才給你年糕的嘛

687
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,232
All right, then. Let's throw you
a party with cake from now on.

688
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:50,003
好吧

689
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,533
從今年起 我們就開派對

690
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:52,923
Wow! You're the best, Mom!

691
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:52,632
也會吃蛋糕

692
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,803
哇 媽媽最棒啦

693
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:55,923
Oh, it's a puppy!

694
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:57,672
哦 是小狗

695
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:57,023
Huh? A puppy?

696
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,042
咦 小狗

697
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,233
Look at this.
It's spring again.

698
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:11,052
你看這個

699
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:12,792
春天又來了

700
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,923
Isn't that fascinating?

701
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,692
神奇吧

702
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:27,946


703
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:29,922
Ah, I'm so tired.

704
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:32,622
Mom, I got a 100 on
my English quiz today!

705
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:31,412
哎喲喂 好累

706
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,113
媽媽

707
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:33,942
我今天英語考了一百分呢

708
00:44:32,622 --> 00:44:35,732
I'm super-duper tired because
I used so much brainpower today!

709
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:37,253
用了太多的腦子 超累的

710
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:38,122
Oh, really?

711
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:39,423
是嗎

712
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,622
Wow! It's cake!

713
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:41,952
哇 是蛋糕哎

714
00:44:40,622 --> 00:44:43,232
Are we going to have
a party now, Mom?

715
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:45,253
媽媽 我們這是要開派對嗎

716
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:47,622
Yeah. Come and sit.
Light the candles.

717
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:45,962
嗯

718
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:47,122
趕緊過來坐吧

719
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:48,762
點蠟燭

720
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,423
Is it okay for me to light them?

721
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:51,893
我可以點嗎

722
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,923
You can do it since you're
all grown up now, Eun Tak.

723
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:54,503
我們家恩卓現在長大了 你可以點

724
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,523
Oh yeah.
I'm nine years old now.

725
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:56,873
對哦 我可九歲了呢

726
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:59,122
I even got a 100 on my English
quiz, so this is a cakewalk.

727
00:44:56,873 --> 00:45:00,402
英語都考了一百分 這點事兒還不是小菜一碟

728
00:44:59,122 --> 00:45:01,322
Where did you learn that saying?

729
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:02,713
這種話 你又是從哪兒學來的啊

730
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,123
You don't need to know, Mom.

731
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:04,872
媽媽你不用知道啦

732
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:07,232
I'm just good at picking up these
things from all sorts of people.

733
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:08,612
我就是透過各種人 學話學得夠好了

734
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:10,423
I think I might be a genius...

735
00:45:08,612 --> 00:45:11,082
我看啊 我可能是個天才...

736
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:16,022
What's the matter?
You have to make a wish.

737
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:15,523
怎麼了

738
00:45:15,523 --> 00:45:17,353
你得許願啊

739
00:45:16,022 --> 00:45:18,323
Happy birthday, my little pup!

740
00:45:17,353 --> 00:45:19,993
祝你生日快樂哦 我的小寶貝

741
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,022
It's not really you, Mom.

742
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:22,262
原來不是你啊

743
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:29,123
It's your spirit that
I'm talking to, isn't it?

744
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:27,902
原來真的不是媽媽

745
00:45:27,902 --> 00:45:30,533
而是媽媽的靈魂

746
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:37,122
So... you really can see
everything, can't you?

747
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:33,942
你

748
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:38,812
真的都能看見呀

749
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:42,323
I was hoping that you
wouldn't be able to.

750
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,952
媽媽本來不希望這樣的

751
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,232
Are you dead, Mom?

752
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:49,292
媽媽死了嗎

753
00:45:53,122 --> 00:45:55,023
Really?

754
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:56,393
真的嗎

755
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,923
Where are you, Mom?
Where are you now?

756
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:04,033
媽媽在哪裡

757
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,603
媽媽現在在哪裡

758
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:07,623
At Sageori Hospital.

759
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,042
我在十字路口的醫院裡

760
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:20,733
You'll be getting
a call from the hospital.

761
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:21,953
醫院會聯繫你的

762
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,522
And when you get there,
your aunt will arrive soon.

763
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:25,122
去了之後 姨媽馬上就會到

764
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:27,022
It's cold at night, so make
sure you have a scarf on.

765
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:28,592
晚上很冷 記得帶圍巾

766
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:30,123
Ask the granny at the supermarket
to go with you too. Okay?

767
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,493
去找小賣部奶奶和你一起去

768
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,323
You know how to get to
her place, right?

769
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:33,962
能找到小賣部奶奶吧

770
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:38,323
Go down the alleyway next to
the dry cleaners and then make a right.

771
00:46:35,363 --> 00:46:37,583
從洗衣店路口往下走

772
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,803
就在一下去的右手邊

773
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:40,622
Oh, you're so clever,
my little pup!

774
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,972
真聰明 我的小寶貝

775
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:48,423
Don't ever look another spirit
in the eye from now on, okay?

776
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:48,512
以後絕對不要和靈魂對視

777
00:46:48,512 --> 00:46:50,082
知道了嗎

778
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:53,622
I'm sorry, Mom, that I can see spirits.

779
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:52,983
對不起 媽媽

780
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:54,882
因為我能看見那些

781
00:46:55,023 --> 00:47:01,522
But it's because I can see spirits
that I can see you now.

782
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:59,922
但就是因為我能看見那些

783
00:47:00,093 --> 00:47:03,093
才能看見媽媽

784
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,732
I'm okay, Mom.

785
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:08,203
所以 我沒關係

786
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,243
Okay.

787
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:09,633
好

788
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,522
Thank you so much...

789
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,942
你能這樣看著媽媽

790
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:16,623
for seeing me like this.

791
00:47:16,472 --> 00:47:18,173
謝謝你

792
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:27,522
I... I think that
I have to go now.

793
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:21,842
恩卓

794
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:25,213
媽媽...

795
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:29,192
媽媽現在似乎該走了

796
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,523
I love you, my little pup.

797
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:34,823
我愛你 我家小寶貝

798
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:39,823
Me too.
I love you too, Mom.

799
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:39,303
我也是

800
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:41,403
我也愛你 媽媽

801
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:43,823
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

802
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:43,503
媽媽再見

803
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:45,302
媽媽走好

804
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:48,823
You have to go to heaven, okay?

805
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:49,873
媽媽一定要去天堂 好嗎

806
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,533
You have to!

807
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:51,213
一定

808
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:52,943
一定哦

809
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:07,823
Mom!

810
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:09,092
媽媽

811
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,132
Mom!

812
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:21,402
媽媽

813
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:32,533
<i>Hello? Is this
Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home?</i>

814
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,523
你好 請問是池蓮熙家嗎

815
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,722
<i>This is Sageori Jaeil
Hospital, and...</i>

816
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:35,082
這裡是十字路口第一醫院

817
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:36,823
I know.
I'll head over there.

818
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:38,093
我知道 我會去的

819
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,923
I'm not going to make a wish.

820
00:49:01,943 --> 00:49:03,082
願望

821
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:05,183
我才不要許願

822
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,323
I'm not going to make
even a single wish.

823
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,453
一個都不許

824
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,323
Nobody ever grants
them for me anyway.

825
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:09,453
反正沒有人會聽

826
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,132
So who would I even
make the wish to?

827
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:11,453
向誰許願呢

828
00:49:30,722 --> 00:49:34,923
How is it that you never
seem to grow old, Granny?

829
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:35,982
奶奶怎麼都不會老呢

830
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:38,533
How could I possibly get
any older than this?

831
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:39,753
還能怎麼繼續老呢

832
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,923
You do have a point.

833
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:42,452
那倒也是

834
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:51,633
Can't you check up on my Eun Tak
every once in a while?

835
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:52,803
偶爾照顧一下我們恩卓 不行嗎

836
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,133
Spouting such nonsense again.

837
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,362
不要

838
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,133
Why would I check up
on your daughter?

839
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:56,603
你的女兒 我為什麼要照顧

840
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,923
Just every once in a while!

841
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:59,373
我說偶爾嘛

842
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,633
Give her some leftover
cabbage if you have any

843
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:02,103
如果有剩下的白菜就給她一點

844
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,633
and some spinach, too.

845
00:50:02,103 --> 00:50:04,143
菠菜也給一點

846
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,423
You should've just died then. Why did you
have to ask them to give you more time?

847
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:05,713
所以 那時候一起死多好

848
00:50:05,713 --> 00:50:07,713
為什麼非要多活這些日子

849
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,903
You're so mean.

850
00:50:09,183 --> 00:50:11,183
你這話說的

851
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,532
You're the one who told me
to plead with them with all my heart.

852
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:13,652
明明是奶奶告訴我的

853
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:16,652
讓我虔誠地祈求

854
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,823
And you actually believed that?

855
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:20,092
竟然會有人相信那句話

856
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:23,323
And thanks to that, I got to live
for a bit longer before I had to go.

857
00:50:20,993 --> 00:50:22,393
就因為相信了那句話

858
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:24,463
我才能多活一段時間

859
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,632
Thanks for everything, Granny.

860
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:27,862
謝謝你 奶奶

861
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:34,423
I came to say goodbye.

862
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:35,542
我是來和你道別的

863
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:40,423
I'm... going now.

864
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:41,882
我要走了

865
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:10,446


866
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,532
Who are you, Mister?

867
00:51:12,813 --> 00:51:16,052
叔... 叔叔是誰

868
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:24,823
You... can see me?

869
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:24,923
你

870
00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:26,463
看得到我嗎

871
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,323
Oh, my scarf. I didn't put it on.
Mom's going to yell at me.

872
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,963
圍巾 我沒戴圍巾

873
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,433
我要被媽媽罵了

874
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,222
You have it on already, though.

875
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:34,502
你明明戴了 圍巾

876
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,423
This is Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home, right?

877
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,333
這裡是池蓮熙家吧

878
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:38,823
I came here since her spirit
wasn't at the hospital.

879
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,173
因為她不在醫院 我才來的

880
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:44,633
But how is a child like you, who wasn't
supposed to have been born...

881
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:42,202
不過怎麼會...

882
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:45,542
你本是不該出生的孩子

883
00:51:49,402 --> 00:51:50,862
??

884
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,533
Did you, by any chance,
become nine years old this year?

885
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:56,693
你今年是9歲嗎

886
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:59,633
I can't hear your voice
at all, Mister.

887
00:51:57,452 --> 00:52:00,992
我根本聽不到叔叔的聲音

888
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:04,222
What brings you here, ma'am?

889
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:05,493
您怎麼會在這兒

890
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,532
Go. And leave this child alone.

891
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:11,433
-走吧 別管這個孩子
-奶奶

892
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:09,923
Granny!

893
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:17,222
You're getting in the way of my work.

894
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:18,512
您這是妨礙公務

895
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:19,132
As if.

896
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:20,612
什麼妨礙公務

897
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:20,922
Why are you trying to take her now
when it's already been so long?

898
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:22,342
都什麼時候的事了 你現在才來做

899
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:23,132
I'm glad for this chance.
Better late than never.

900
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,313
現在能做真是萬幸

901
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:24,722
I have no time right now.

902
00:52:24,313 --> 00:52:26,082
我現在沒有時間

903
00:52:24,722 --> 00:52:26,533
That's your problem.

904
00:52:26,082 --> 00:52:27,883
那是你的事情

905
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,722
Do you have this child's
name on your list?

906
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,823
這個孩子在生死簿上嗎

907
00:52:28,722 --> 00:52:32,533
She had no name back then,
but she has a name now.

908
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,753
雖然當時那個孩子無名

909
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:33,723
但現在這個孩子是有名字的

910
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:36,133
If you have a certificate with
her name on it, hand it over.

911
00:52:33,723 --> 00:52:36,062
如果有寫著這孩子名字的生死簿

912
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:37,333
你倒是拿給我看看

913
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,722
I'll hand her over if you do.

914
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,793
那我就放她走

915
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:41,823
If I'm going to get that, I need to get
nine years' worth of evidence on her.

916
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:40,702
如果要得到冥府的協助

917
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:43,132
就要有9年內所有的證明

918
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:43,633
You, of all people, should know...

919
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:44,833
您明知道...

920
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:57,033
I'll be seeing you again, child.

921
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,082
再見

922
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,452
小朋友

923
00:53:03,322 --> 00:53:06,033
Granny! Mom is...

924
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:07,192
奶奶 我媽媽...

925
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:08,923
I know. And we can't
do anything about that.

926
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:10,063
我知道 那沒辦法

927
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,132
But you have to live.

928
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,493
你得好好活著

929
00:53:10,132 --> 00:53:14,323
You have to move within three days
if you don't want him to find you.

930
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:13,802
你要趕緊搬家 在3天內

931
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:15,662
這樣他才找不到你

932
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:18,922
You've looked a God of Death in the
eye, so you can't live here any longer.

933
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,203
你和地獄使者對視了

934
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:20,503
不能繼續在這裡生活了

935
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:21,722
He won't be able to
find me if I move?

936
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:22,972
如果搬走的話 他就找不到我嗎

937
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:23,422
No, he won't.

938
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:24,643
找不到

939
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:25,632
That's why land is so important.

940
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:26,982
所以才說選址很重要

941
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:34,823
After midnight, a man and two women
will come for you at the funeral parlor.

942
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,912
過了今日子夜

943
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:36,352
會有一男兩女到殯儀館找你

944
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:36,722
Go with them.

945
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:38,022
跟著他們走吧

946
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:44,823
It'll be hard on you,
but you have no other choice.

947
00:53:40,993 --> 00:53:43,032
可能往後日子有點辛苦

948
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,163
但你沒有別的選擇

949
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:50,923
But why are you telling
me all of this?

950
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:52,603
但是為什麼要告訴我這些呢

951
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,133
Because I've taken a liking to you.

952
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,503
因為我喜歡你

953
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,423
When she was pregnant with you...

954
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:57,943
你出生的時候

955
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,532
she was so happy.

956
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,783
我覺得很幸福

957
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:07,423
Here. A birthday gift.

958
00:54:05,953 --> 00:54:09,052
這是給你的生日禮物

959
00:54:54,222 --> 00:54:57,133
<i>[10 YEARS LATER]</i>

960
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:58,093
<i>-=10年後=-</i>

961
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,132
Excuse me.

962
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:13,383
那個...

963
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:22,323
Want to get a drink with me?

964
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:23,662
我們一起喝一杯吧

965
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,323
Sure.

966
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,332
好呀

967
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:32,722
<i>This card worked up until
yesterday, but now it doesn't!</i>

968
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:32,403
不是 昨天還好好的卡

969
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:34,343
突然就不能用了

970
00:55:32,722 --> 00:55:34,423
<i>So, um, Uncle.</i>

971
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:35,673
所以我想說 叔叔

972
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,633
<i>There are some unfriendly
guys in suits at the bar.</i>

973
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:37,473
酒吧裡不是有穿著西裝

974
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:39,812
不太友好的男人嘛

975
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:42,133
<i>I'm, um, with those people right now.</i>

976
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:41,583
我現在和那些傢夥...

977
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,583
那些人在一起

978
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,423
<i>So please, pick up the phone!</i>

979
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,882
所以 拜託你接一下電話吧

980
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,423
<i>They asked for your cell phone number</i>

981
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:47,352
他們讓我說出你的手機號

982
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:49,823
<i>and got really unfriendly when
I told them that you don't have one.</i>

983
00:55:47,352 --> 00:55:48,922
我說我叔叔沒有手機

984
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:51,522
他們就對我特別不友好

985
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,823
<i>Uncle. Are you listening?</i>

986
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:54,463
叔叔 你在聽嗎

987
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:57,133
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

988
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:56,393
叔叔

989
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,433
叔叔

990
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,533
<i>Uncle!</i>

991
00:55:58,562 --> 00:56:00,702
叔叔

992
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:06,722
She still eats by herself even
though it's the end of senior year.

993
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:08,073
高三都要結束了她還是一個人吃飯

994
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,132
If you feel that bad for her,
go and eat with her yourself.

995
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:10,442
覺得她可憐 就去一起吃啊

996
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,923
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

997
00:56:10,442 --> 00:56:12,012
瘋了嗎 我為什麼要那樣

998
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:12,632
That girl sees spirits!

999
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:13,743
她能看見鬼

1000
00:56:12,632 --> 00:56:14,323
I'm more scared of her
than I am of ghosts.

1001
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,883
比起鬼 我覺得她更可怕

1002
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:16,722
At least you can't see ghosts.

1003
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:18,152
至少我們看不見鬼

1004
00:56:17,222 --> 00:56:21,533
Look. She can hear everything we're
saying, but she's acting as if she can't.

1005
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:19,622
你們看她

1006
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:22,622
明明聽得到 卻還裝聽不到

1007
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,923
Hey.

1008
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:37,102
喂

1009
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:41,033
Hey, I heard that
you're the Goblin's Bride.

1010
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,343
喂 聽說你是鬼怪新娘

1011
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:44,533
Come on, I know you can see me.

1012
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:45,513
你明明看得到我

1013
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,323
Come with me.
It's just that I'm so lonely!

1014
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:50,452
和我一起走吧 我太孤單了

1015
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:49,323
Please?

1016
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,533
Hey, why do you keep ignoring me?

1017
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:53,623
喂 你為什麼裝作看不見我

1018
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:56,133
You evil girl!

1019
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:57,193
壞女人

1020
00:56:57,222 --> 00:56:58,923
Oh, geez!

1021
00:56:58,422 --> 00:57:00,193
這個外形真是...

1022
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:02,133
See? I knew you could see me.

1023
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:03,792
看吧 你明明看得見我

1024
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:11,923
Wait, so it's true?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1025
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:09,933
傳聞是真的

1026
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:13,302
對... 對不起 對不起 對不起

1027
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:17,823
What was that? Why did she
apologize all of the sudden?

1028
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:16,643
什麼呀

1029
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:19,112
怎麼莫名其妙的道歉

1030
00:59:10,432 --> 00:59:13,223
You didn't even turn on
any of the lights, Your Lordship.

1031
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:16,362
也不開燈

1032
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:16,483
I was lost in my thoughts.

1033
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:19,563
我想事情想得太入神了

1034
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:22,123
These are the materials you
requested of me from the NIS.

1035
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:25,203
這是你在國外的住處

1036
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:29,463
<i>-=大韓民國=-</i>

1037
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:30,303
Then...

1038
00:59:30,812 --> 00:59:32,722
Yes. It's happened, Your Lordship.

1039
00:59:32,143 --> 00:59:33,582
這麼快...

1040
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:36,112
是的 很快

1041
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:39,323
Duk Hwa is already 25 years old now.

1042
00:59:39,223 --> 00:59:42,753
德華都已經25歲了

1043
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:44,722
I've pulled a lot of strings so you can
leave near the end of the month.

1044
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:45,493
我已經讓他多去見識見識了

1045
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:47,763
這個月底左右再走吧

1046
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,722
If you leave now, Your Lordship...

1047
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:56,233
您這次離開

1048
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,622
this will be the last time in
my lifetime I'll see you, correct?

1049
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:01,172
估計我很難再見到您了

1050
01:00:05,192 --> 01:00:09,532
I thank you for every second
that we've shared together.

1051
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:09,612
感謝你

1052
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:12,982
陪我走過每一個瞬間

1053
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,823
Duk Hwa will be here
when you return, sir.

1054
01:00:14,183 --> 01:00:19,192
當您歸來時 德華會在這裡

1055
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:25,082
I've been losing my keys
all the time lately

1056
01:00:23,463 --> 01:00:27,563
我總忘記帶鑰匙

1057
01:00:25,082 --> 01:00:28,593
so I've had the lock
changed to a keyless one.

1058
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:30,402
所以換成了密碼鎖

1059
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,022
Grandpa! Uncle Shin!

1060
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:33,342
爺爺 叔叔

1061
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:37,383
There you are, Uncle Shin.
I begged you to come and pick me up.

1062
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:37,142
叔叔 原來你在這裡

1063
01:00:37,142 --> 01:00:40,382
我差點跪下求你來接我了

1064
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:39,292
But here you are.

1065
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,042
Do not interrupt an adults' conversation!

1066
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:41,983
可你都沒挪過地方

1067
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:46,552
長輩在說話 小孩子不要亂插嘴

1068
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:45,523
Did you cancel my card?

1069
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,573
You canceled my card, didn't you!

1070
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:48,123
是爺爺消了我的卡 對不對

1071
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:49,332
Yeah, I canceled it, you brat.

1072
01:00:48,123 --> 01:00:50,022
是你消的 對不對

1073
01:00:49,332 --> 01:00:52,813
Ugh, I was totally humiliated!
Do you know how tough she was to get to?

1074
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,853
是我秘書消的 臭小子

1075
01:00:51,853 --> 01:00:55,492
我丟臉丟到姥姥家了 好不容易撩到的

1076
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,143
Why did you even make me your heir
if you were going to treat me like this?

1077
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:57,992
早知如此 幹嘛把我弄成富三代

1078
01:00:58,262 --> 01:01:01,193
Uncle Shin, are you going somewhere?

1079
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:03,272
叔叔 你要走了嗎

1080
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:06,913
- Where are you going?
- I told you to speak with more respect!

1081
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:06,402
去哪兒

1082
01:01:06,402 --> 01:01:09,442
說了多少遍 改改你的口氣

1083
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,223
Stay out of this, Grandpa.

1084
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:12,532
Is it about that thing again?
About you looking for your bride?

1085
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:11,342
爺爺 您先打住

1086
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,082
難道是那件事 找你的新娘

1087
01:01:12,532 --> 01:01:15,833
Why can't you just say that you're
leaving to get married somewhere?

1088
01:01:15,082 --> 01:01:18,353
我說 去國際婚姻就去唄 為什麼不說出來

1089
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,832
Why can't you say it!

1090
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,152
為什麼不說出來

1091
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,452
You're saying this kid will be here
when I return?

1092
01:01:22,452 --> 01:01:26,443
Uncle Shin, exactly when
and what time are you leaving?

1093
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:24,923
等我回來 就有這孩子 是嗎

1094
01:01:24,923 --> 01:01:28,893
叔叔 哪天 幾點 什麼時候去

1095
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:10,467


1096
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,712
One male and two females!
Your breakfast is ready.

1097
01:02:13,872 --> 01:02:16,942
吃早飯了 一位男士兩位女士

1098
01:02:17,992 --> 01:02:19,612
I said, your breakfast is ready.

1099
01:02:20,512 --> 01:02:22,383
吃飯啦

1100
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:23,503
Shut up, you loudmouth.

1101
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,982
瞎喊什麼

1102
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:26,803
Why are you blabbering so much over
the stupid breakfast you cooked?

1103
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:29,023
做個早飯能不能安靜點

1104
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,233
What's with the seaweed soup?
Is it someone's birthday today?

1105
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:31,323
今天怎麼是海帶湯

1106
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,722
Are you kidding me? Did she make the soup
because it's her birthday or something?

1107
01:02:31,323 --> 01:02:32,693
誰過生日嗎

1108
01:02:32,693 --> 01:02:36,192
給力 這傢夥煮海帶湯慶祝自己生日嗎

1109
01:02:33,722 --> 01:02:35,262
Yeah, it is.

1110
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:40,243
How can she be proud of having killed her
own mom just to be born on this day?

1111
01:02:36,192 --> 01:02:37,633
看來沒錯

1112
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:40,032
剋死自己媽媽的出生日期

1113
01:02:40,032 --> 01:02:42,833
還好意思慶祝

1114
01:02:40,243 --> 01:02:42,463
She's shameless because
she doesn't know any better.

1115
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,883
Whatever she learned, she got it from you
since she's been with us for 10 years.

1116
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,903
不學無術 所以也不知道什麼叫丟人

1117
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:46,573
這話有理

1118
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,563
Shut up and eat your food.

1119
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:48,443
她在我們這兒十年了

1120
01:02:48,443 --> 01:02:49,913
吃你的飯吧

1121
01:02:48,512 --> 01:02:51,082
Thanks for wishing me a happy birthday.

1122
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,983
謝謝您給我過生日 姨媽

1123
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:56,262
This is why people say that
you should never take in a stray.

1124
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:58,783
所以說 烏髮畜生不知恩啊

1125
01:02:56,262 --> 01:02:58,023
Being too compassionate is my downfall.

1126
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:02,072
I'm the pitiful one here since
I've raised her in her mother's stead.

1127
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:00,553
多情也是病啊

1128
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:02,722
真替死去的她感到不值

1129
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:04,602
Your words are a bit harsh.

1130
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:04,493
我還把你辛辛苦苦拉扯大

1131
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:06,362
您這說得就有點過分了

1132
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:06,432
How is it harsh?

1133
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:08,413
She may be your mom,
but she's my older sister.

1134
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:08,923
有什麼過分的

1135
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:11,563
Exactly. She and I are closer in
both heart and connection.

1136
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:10,862
對你來說 是媽媽 可也是我的姐姐

1137
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:14,133
所以說啊
無論是內心還是血緣關係 我離她更近

1138
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:15,092
- Do you even know what you're saying?
- Shut up and eat your food.

1139
01:03:14,133 --> 01:03:15,902
媽 你知道你在說什麼嗎

1140
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:17,483
Where are you running off to?

1141
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:17,332
吃你的飯去

1142
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:20,283
I'm not running off anywhere.
I'm going to school.

1143
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,003
往哪兒逃

1144
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:22,472
不是逃 而是上學

1145
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:30,053
You're dead if you touch those umbrellas.

1146
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,512
Meet me at the bank
with your bankbook after school.

1147
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:31,912
敢拿雨傘打死你

1148
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:34,593
You know what will happen
if you don't, right?

1149
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:35,022
放學以後帶上存摺去銀行

1150
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:38,222
How many times have I told you
that I don't have a bankbook?

1151
01:03:35,022 --> 01:03:37,293
今天還不帶來 你知道什麼後果

1152
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:39,123
我說了 我沒有存摺

1153
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:40,962
到底要說幾遍

1154
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:47,442
Then where's the bankbook?
Where's your mom's insurance money?

1155
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:47,302
那存摺在哪

1156
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:49,902
你媽的保險金在哪

1157
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,993
How would I know that?

1158
01:03:54,303 --> 01:03:56,542
我怎麼知道

1159
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:58,673
You took all the money for yourself!
You even took the money from our house!

1160
01:03:57,373 --> 01:04:01,042
都被你拿走了 被你全拿走了

1161
01:03:59,262 --> 01:04:02,693
Why is she talking
so much crap this morning?

1162
01:04:01,843 --> 01:04:05,383
大清早的浪費口水

1163
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:05,623
Just shut up and bring it
unless you want to get your ass beaten.

1164
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,683
廢話少說 記得帶來

1165
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:07,932
The bankbook disappears whenever
I need to go to the bank

1166
01:04:06,683 --> 01:04:08,222
不想被打死的話

1167
01:04:07,932 --> 01:04:09,163
and who else could it be but you?

1168
01:04:08,222 --> 01:04:10,323
在背包裡的存摺 怎麼一到銀行就不翼而飛

1169
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,813
I'm telling you that
the bitch is possessed.

1170
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:11,722
如果不是你 還能是誰

1171
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,092
早說了 這女的鬼上身了

1172
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:15,233
That's right.
There's a ghost right behind you.

1173
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,792
What! You crazy bitch!

1174
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:17,762
你說得對 你後背上趴著鬼

1175
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:20,203
什麼 你這傢夥

1176
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:29,772
<i>My lordship.</i>

1177
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:34,173
Will you be traveling alone
this time too?

1178
01:05:29,802 --> 01:05:32,643
可是 老爺

1179
01:05:32,643 --> 01:05:36,142
這次也是獨自離開嗎

1180
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,523
Yes, it would seem so.

1181
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:41,283
No women I've ever met has been
able to see the sword.

1182
01:05:37,913 --> 01:05:40,183
是啊

1183
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:43,712
我遇到的那些女子 都看不到那把劍

1184
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,612
Which is of a great relief to me.

1185
01:05:43,612 --> 01:05:50,643
I hope the bride appears quickly for you
when you're in agony over the sword.

1186
01:05:43,712 --> 01:05:46,352
我是感到慶幸

1187
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:53,393
您因那把劍飽受煎熬時 我希望新娘能早日出現

1188
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:55,323
But if the sword is seen,
I hope no one finds out about it.

1189
01:05:53,393 --> 01:05:58,132
而像現在這般平靜時 又希望誰都不知道

1190
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:59,493
That's just human greed, I guess.

1191
01:05:58,132 --> 01:06:01,632
這就是人類的貪念吧

1192
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:03,972
It's a relief for me too.

1193
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:05,902
我也感到慶幸

1194
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:09,733
To still have you by my side,
and a full drink in my hand besides.

1195
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:09,743
你還陪伴在我身邊

1196
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:13,313
For tonight at least,
I'd like to remain alive.

1197
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:12,512
而且有一大瓶酒

1198
01:06:12,512 --> 01:06:16,052
今晚我想活著

1199
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,632
Shall we drink to that?

1200
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:20,753
那就乾杯吧

1201
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:54,052
When I was nine years old,
I told myself that I'd never do this.

1202
01:06:52,382 --> 01:06:56,623
我九歲那年下定決心再也不做這種事了

1203
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:57,332
But I'm desperate right now,
so I hope you understand.

1204
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:59,393
可當時太心急了 還望您諒解

1205
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,883
Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives

1206
01:07:02,193 --> 01:07:03,632
請讓我找到一份兼職

1207
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:06,083
and please help me find a boyfriend!

1208
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:05,292
請讓姨媽一家別這麼對我

1209
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:08,232
請賜給我一個男朋友 求您了

1210
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,063
<i>Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives</i>

1211
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:14,743
請讓我找到一份兼職

1212
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,843
and help me improve my pathetic life.

1213
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,573
請讓姨媽一家別這麼對我

1214
01:07:16,573 --> 01:07:19,283
請想想辦法 救救苦命的我

1215
01:07:16,843 --> 01:07:18,882
Even 100 won in my pocket
would be fine! Please.

1216
01:07:19,283 --> 01:07:21,713
一丁點也行啊

1217
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,862
What in the world am I doing?

1218
01:07:25,862 --> 01:07:28,033
Who am I even praying to?

1219
01:07:26,353 --> 01:07:27,683
我在幹什麼

1220
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,492
There is no god.

1221
01:07:28,923 --> 01:07:30,753
求誰啊

1222
01:07:30,753 --> 01:07:32,863
哪有什麼神仙

1223
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:47,112
You're seriously not going to
make it rain right now, are you?

1224
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:49,143
難不成還要下雨嗎

1225
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:50,673
It's not even the rainy season!

1226
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:53,213
這是場雷陣雨 還是苦雨啊

1227
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:53,472
Will the rain even stop?
Will it ever?

1228
01:07:53,213 --> 01:07:56,183
這雨會停吧

1229
01:07:53,472 --> 01:07:58,993
Why do you keep making it rain when
I don't even have an umbrella of my own?

1230
01:07:56,183 --> 01:08:01,722
就弟弟妹妹有雨傘 為什麼還總下雨

1231
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:03,733
- Was it you?
- Oh my goodness.

1232
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:04,692
是你嗎

1233
01:08:04,692 --> 01:08:06,092
嚇死我了

1234
01:08:07,073 --> 01:08:08,942
Me?

1235
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:10,692
我嗎

1236
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:17,862
Me?

1237
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,913
- Were you talking to me?
- Yeah, you.

1238
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:20,143
我嗎

1239
01:08:21,273 --> 01:08:23,872
你是在和我說話嗎

1240
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:23,913
Was it you?

1241
01:08:23,872 --> 01:08:25,542
對 你

1242
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,623
- What about me?
- Were you the one who summoned me?

1243
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,012
是你嗎

1244
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:30,283
- Me? I didn't summon you.
- You did summon me.

1245
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:27,713
什麼

1246
01:08:27,713 --> 01:08:29,112
把我叫來的人是不是你

1247
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:31,012
我嗎 我沒叫你

1248
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:33,423
- But just how did you summon me?
- How would I have summoned you?

1249
01:08:31,012 --> 01:08:32,983
你叫了

1250
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,352
你到底怎麼叫我出來的

1251
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:37,003
- I seriously didn't summon you.
- You definitely did summon me.

1252
01:08:34,352 --> 01:08:37,553
我沒做什麼啊 真的沒叫你

1253
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:40,563
- Try to remember how you summoned me.
- Desperately?

1254
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:39,463
你分明叫了

1255
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:41,222
好好想想是怎麼叫的

1256
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:42,962
迫切的

1257
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:46,982
I didn't summon you.
I'm just able to see you.

1258
01:08:44,763 --> 01:08:47,032
不是我叫你的

1259
01:08:46,982 --> 01:08:50,593
Because we accidentally locked eyes
when we passed each other the other day.

1260
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:49,433
只是我的眼睛能看到你

1261
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:52,402
上次在大街上和你對視了

1262
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:53,213
You're him, aren't you?

1263
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:57,012
- What do you mean, you can see me?
- You're a ghost, aren't you?

1264
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:55,742
是那位叔叔 對不對

1265
01:08:56,672 --> 01:08:57,772
能看到 你這是什麼意思

1266
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:59,482
I'm able to see ghosts.

1267
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,582
你不是鬼嗎

1268
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:02,563
- I'm not a ghost.
- That's what they all say at first.

1269
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:02,283
我能看到鬼

1270
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:02,983
我不是鬼

1271
01:09:02,983 --> 01:09:05,012
一開始都這麼說

1272
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:07,663
Who are you?

1273
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,333
Why can't you see what you
should see right in front of you?

1274
01:09:08,283 --> 01:09:10,393
你到底是什麼人

1275
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:14,122
- What am I supposed to see?
- Your twenties, thirties... your future.

1276
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:12,792
為什麼本該看到的東西一點也看不到了

1277
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:14,493
應該看到什麼

1278
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:17,112
Maybe because there is no future for me.

1279
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:16,862
20歲 30歲 你的未來

1280
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:19,232
看來我可能沒有未來吧

1281
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:23,353
Were you a shaman or something
before you died? Or a con man?

1282
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:24,133
話說回來 你死之前是跳大繩的嗎

1283
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:27,612
- My future, my butt.
- What? A con, what?

1284
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:25,703
還是騙子

1285
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:28,273
還什麼未來呢

1286
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:31,742
Go to the light.
Wandering around for too long isn't good.

1287
01:09:28,273 --> 01:09:30,012
什...什麼 什麼子

1288
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:31,573
請你往生極樂吧

1289
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:34,413
徘徊太久不好的

1290
01:09:34,682 --> 01:09:37,923
- What's with those flowers?
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

1291
01:09:37,112 --> 01:09:39,123
可那花是怎麼回事

1292
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,563
Okay, leave.

1293
01:09:39,123 --> 01:09:40,423
你不是叫我往生極樂嗎 還搭話

1294
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:41,633
They're buckwheat flowers.

1295
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:42,852
知道了 快去往生吧

1296
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:46,432
But that's not what I'm asking.
Why are you holding those flowers?

1297
01:09:42,852 --> 01:09:44,653
蕎麥花

1298
01:09:44,653 --> 01:09:47,093
我不是問這個

1299
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,662
Give them to me.
They don't really suit you.

1300
01:09:47,093 --> 01:09:49,093
我問的是你為什麼要拿在手裡

1301
01:09:49,093 --> 01:09:52,062
給我吧 和你不搭

1302
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,713
I've never been told that before.
I've seriously never been told that.

1303
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:54,933
頭一次聽到有人這麼說

1304
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:57,033
真的是頭一次 真的

1305
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:57,482
You can just give them to me.

1306
01:09:57,482 --> 01:10:00,223
It's my birthday today.

1307
01:09:58,172 --> 01:09:59,772
給我吧

1308
01:10:00,503 --> 01:10:02,573
今天是我的生日

1309
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,392
A very depressing birthday.

1310
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:06,883
非常憂鬱的生日

1311
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:19,233
I get nothing but weeds for my birthday.

1312
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:21,162
看來 我的生日禮物和草有緣

1313
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:22,432
I got a napa cabbage
for my ninth birthday.

1314
01:10:21,923 --> 01:10:24,933
9歲時 我收到的是大白菜

1315
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:27,862
But what is the meaning
of these buckwheat flowers?

1316
01:10:26,563 --> 01:10:30,673
可蕎麥花的花語是什麼呢

1317
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:29,823
Lovers.

1318
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:32,003
戀人

1319
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:52,847


1320
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:57,232
Why were you crying?

1321
01:10:57,232 --> 01:11:00,593
Job, relatives, or boyfriend?
Which of the three were you crying over?

1322
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:59,533
你為什麼在哭

1323
01:10:59,862 --> 01:11:03,272
兼職 姨媽一家 男朋友 三個當中因為哪個

1324
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,343
- How did you know that?
- I heard you.

1325
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:04,603
你怎麼知道的

1326
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,463
What do you mean, you heard it?

1327
01:11:04,603 --> 01:11:05,872
聽到了

1328
01:11:05,872 --> 01:11:08,942
聽到了...是什麼意思

1329
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,803
- I grant some people their wishes.
- You grant people their wishes?

1330
01:11:09,112 --> 01:11:11,442
我有時會幫人實現願望

1331
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:14,542
幫人實現願望

1332
01:11:13,593 --> 01:11:17,772
Like a magic genie?
Or a guardian angel?

1333
01:11:16,612 --> 01:11:20,523
像有魔力那樣的守護神那種嗎

1334
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:21,242
Are you serious?
I knew it.

1335
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:23,893
真的啊 我就說嘛

1336
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:25,492
I knew you were different from other
ghosts from the moment I first saw you.

1337
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:28,192
看你的第一眼 就覺得和其他鬼不一樣

1338
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:28,672
- Are you really my guardian angel?
- I didn't say I was your guardian angel.

1339
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:29,893
真的是我的守護神嗎

1340
01:11:28,672 --> 01:11:33,773
My mom once told me that everyone is born
with their own life dictionary.

1341
01:11:29,893 --> 01:11:31,192
我可沒說是你的守護神

1342
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:33,033
我媽說過

1343
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:36,303
每個人出生時都帶著屬於自己的字典

1344
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:41,552
And in my dictionary, words such as
"Luck" or "Fortune" don't exist.

1345
01:11:36,303 --> 01:11:38,303
而我的字典裡

1346
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:44,743
無論怎麼翻找也找不到幸福 幸運這種詞

1347
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:47,393
- You know what I mean, right?
- No, I don't.

1348
01:11:46,743 --> 01:11:49,152
你懂我的意思吧

1349
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,203
I'm asking if I can have
about five million.

1350
01:11:49,152 --> 01:11:50,312
不懂

1351
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:53,922
就是問你 能不能通融個五百萬之類的

1352
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:56,073
If getting me the cash is too tough,
then tell me the winning lottery numbers.

1353
01:11:53,922 --> 01:11:57,722
如果不能用現金
告訴我本週的彩券開獎號碼也好

1354
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:59,643
Go and say goodbye to your family.
You won't get to see them for a while.

1355
01:11:57,722 --> 01:11:58,792
這也是願望之一

1356
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:00,862
你和家人告個別

1357
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,813
Keep looking for a job at a chicken
restaurant. You'll find something soon.

1358
01:12:00,862 --> 01:12:02,292
估計有段時間見不到他們了

1359
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:05,692
在雞肉店努力打工 會被錄用的

1360
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:11,903
Hey! What about my boyfriend?

1361
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:12,203
我說...

1362
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:14,973
Hello? Hey!

1363
01:12:12,472 --> 01:12:14,643
那我男朋友呢

1364
01:12:14,643 --> 01:12:17,942
我說...你在嗎

1365
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:18,033
Ugh, what a poor sport!

1366
01:12:18,313 --> 01:12:20,482
真是的 小氣鬼

1367
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:35,133
- I haven't met you before.
- Likewise.

1368
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:35,992
似曾相識

1369
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,472
But I have heard rumors.

1370
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:37,862
確實如此

1371
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:40,313
There are all sorts of rumors about me.

1372
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:40,132
聽說過有關你的許多傳聞

1373
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:42,903
我的傳聞裡有很多虛假的

1374
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,402
What are you doing in my home?

1375
01:12:42,402 --> 01:12:43,773
You live here?

1376
01:12:42,903 --> 01:12:45,073
來我家有何貴幹

1377
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:47,523
All the furniture you see is included,
so you just need to move in...

1378
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:46,442
你住在這裡

1379
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:50,172
這裡傢俱齊全 您只要住進來...

1380
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:51,503
When did you get home, Uncle Shin?

1381
01:12:51,972 --> 01:12:53,913
你什麼時候回來的 叔叔

1382
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:54,582
- Explain.
- The thing is...

1383
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:56,692
this house is going to sit vacant
for like 20 years.

1384
01:12:55,213 --> 01:12:55,913
解釋

1385
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:59,152
叔叔 反正這裡要空著20年

1386
01:12:56,692 --> 01:13:02,543
I thought about the money we could make
by charging someone monthly rent...

1387
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,253
所以我就想 這20年得多少房租啊

1388
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:05,152
我就以這單純的好奇心為出發點...

1389
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:05,073
Do you even know what that is?
That thing over there is...

1390
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:07,243
Don't refer to our new tenant as "that"!

1391
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:06,823
你知道這傢伙是幹什麼的嗎

1392
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:07,592
跟這東西...

1393
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,762
你對新住戶太沒禮貌了

1394
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,983
He owns tea houses.

1395
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:12,362
他說要開茶店

1396
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,692
I'm sorry, I apologize.
My uncle is socially awkward.

1397
01:13:13,692 --> 01:13:15,632
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

1398
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:16,332
不好意思 我叔叔社會經驗太少

1399
01:13:16,332 --> 01:13:17,933
請喝咖啡吧

1400
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:22,652
- He hasn't paid yet.
- I saw the new car out front.

1401
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,342
還沒收錢呢

1402
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:25,143
- It's the new tenant's car.
- It's not my car.

1403
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:25,542
院子裡有輛新車

1404
01:13:25,143 --> 01:13:26,902
And I've already given all my money...

1405
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,783
那是他的車

1406
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,842
不是我的車

1407
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:29,383
錢也已經...

1408
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,003
to him.

1409
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,052
Then I'll give you your money back,
so leave.

1410
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:32,383
給完了

1411
01:13:32,853 --> 01:13:35,653
事已至此 錢我會如數奉還 出去吧

1412
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:38,353
I know you'd give me my money back,
but I've already signed the papers.

1413
01:13:35,653 --> 01:13:37,753
事已至此

1414
01:13:37,753 --> 01:13:40,823
合同書上都蓋完章...

1415
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:46,802
- I hope that wasn't very important.
- That was just a copy.

1416
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:48,262
希望不是重要的文件

1417
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,823
The real estate agent has the original
and my stuff will be here tomorrow.

1418
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:49,472
剛才那是複印的

1419
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:50,622
I don't have any plans tomorrow.

1420
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:51,402
正本在房地產公司 行李明天會搬進來

1421
01:13:50,622 --> 01:13:54,323
If you're done with your coffee, leave.
My hospitality ends here.

1422
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:53,042
因為是良辰吉日

1423
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,672
喝完就走

1424
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:55,643
Go and pack your bags.

1425
01:13:54,672 --> 01:13:56,972
我的寬宏大量僅限一杯咖啡

1426
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:57,832
If you're leaving for the next 20 years,
then you should start packing now.

1427
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,242
你還是進去打包行李吧

1428
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:01,133
You really want to start with a goblin?

1429
01:13:58,242 --> 01:14:00,382
20年的行李 夠你忙一陣子的

1430
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:04,283
想看到鬼怪發怒的面孔 是嗎

1431
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,772
I'm sure you're aware of what it means
to sign a contract with the grim reaper.

1432
01:14:04,772 --> 01:14:08,512
How about I take that young boy
instead of this house, then?

1433
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,353
你應該很清楚與使者之間的契約是什麼

1434
01:14:07,353 --> 01:14:10,853
<i>-=注: 跟死神的契約那種意思=-</i>

1435
01:14:07,353 --> 01:14:10,853
不要這房子 帶走剛剛出去的那個朋友

1436
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:12,573
Nothing else I can do.
Use one of the many empty rooms.

1437
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:13,622
沒辦法

1438
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,522
- Make yourself at home.
- It is my home.

1439
01:14:13,622 --> 01:14:14,993
有很多空房間 用吧

1440
01:14:14,522 --> 01:14:15,622
No, it's my house.

1441
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:16,332
就當成自己家

1442
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:18,563
是我家

1443
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:20,562
If you think you can kick a goblin out of
his own turf, then give it your best try.

1444
01:14:19,402 --> 01:14:23,273
想把鬼怪趕出棲身老巢 我佩服你的勇氣

1445
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:41,133
This is not the nice dinner
I had envisioned for myself.

1446
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:44,313
It's like a horrible restaurant that
I've only heard rumors about.

1447
01:14:42,052 --> 01:14:43,823
還真是野蠻

1448
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:47,122
如傳聞中一樣 是個低俗的組織

1449
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,402
My bad.

1450
01:14:54,433 --> 01:15:00,472
喔 手滑了 本來要好好扔給你的

1451
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:57,353
I was trying to get my soup.

1452
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:05,253
My bad this time.

1453
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:05,912
啊

1454
01:15:05,912 --> 01:15:07,542
我也是手滑了

1455
01:15:06,163 --> 01:15:08,512
I was trying to get you.

1456
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:11,553
- "You"?
- I thought we had settled that earlier.

1457
01:15:08,982 --> 01:15:10,612
本來是扔你身上的

1458
01:15:11,213 --> 01:15:11,883
你

1459
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,673
This. That. Hey. You.

1460
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,152
剛才不是定了怎麼稱呼的嗎

1461

1462
01:15:15,523 --> 01:15:17,792

戀人

1465
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:54,802
Lovers... what a joke.

1466
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:53,762
切

1467
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:57,733

您是老闆嗎

1474
01:16:20,132 --> 01:16:25,902
I have a very upbeat

我叫池恩卓

非常開朗樂觀

you can ask of me with a smile!

開朗樂觀

1480

再苦再累 只要叫我做 我都能做

1481
01:16:28,972 --> 01:16:30,843
No matter how dirty the job...

about me finding a job.

A guardian angel?
What a liar.

I should've at least gotten his number.

1491
01:17:10,273 --> 01:17:11,933
這人真是

1492
01:17:12,573 --> 01:17:15,103
留了電話號碼就好了

1493
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:29,612
- See? It was you.
- Oh my goodness.

1494
01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:30,823
瞧瞧 是你沒錯

1495
01:17:30,823 --> 01:17:32,493
嚇我一跳

1496
01:17:33,512 --> 01:17:35,203
Why do you keep following me around?

1497
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:38,003
- I didn't follow you. You summoned me.
- No, I didn't.

1498
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:37,692
你為什麼總跟著我

1499
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:39,402
我可沒有跟著你 是你召喚我的

1500
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:40,773
If I had the power to do that,
I wouldn't be suffering like this.

1501
01:17:39,402 --> 01:17:40,563
才不是呢

1502
01:17:40,563 --> 01:17:43,302
我若有那個本事 就不用這麼苦了

1503
01:17:40,773 --> 01:17:43,332
How would I do that?
By shaking a bell or something?

1504
01:17:43,302 --> 01:17:44,503
我有什麼能耐啊

1505
01:17:43,332 --> 01:17:47,853
- Why would you ask me?
- Because you keep arguing with me.

1506
01:17:44,503 --> 01:17:46,003
搖鈴鐺召喚你嗎

1507
01:17:46,003 --> 01:17:47,042
你問我 我問誰啊

1508
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,303
誰讓你一直頂嘴啊

1509
01:17:47,853 --> 01:17:50,773
Anyway, are you sure
you're a guardian angel?

1510
01:17:48,303 --> 01:17:50,343
我才沒召喚你呢

1511
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:51,443
話又說回來

1512
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:52,122
What kind of angel
are you, though?

1513
01:17:51,443 --> 01:17:53,512
你真的是守護神嗎

-那麼是哪裡

1533

- You really don't know what...
- No.

01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:11,732
說得好像真有那麼回事兒似的

It definitely was!

01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,623
I've never had anything like
this happen to me before.

是你 我說是你 是你沒錯

1542
01:18:17,832 --> 01:18:19,773
從未有過這種情況

1543
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:20,522
Was it really me?

what am I, exactly?

you can see about me.

You have a school uniform on.

1557

What else?

1558
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:42,433
穿了校服

1559
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:43,523
You're pretty.

1560
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:43,962

Is that all?

1565
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:55,122
You don't see anything else about me?

1566
01:18:52,172 --> 01:18:53,902
就這些嗎

1567
01:18:55,122 --> 01:18:59,323
I really must be a fairy
or something, like Tinker Bell.

1568
01:18:55,843 --> 01:18:58,143
沒看到翅膀什麼的嗎

1569
01:18:58,143 --> 01:19:00,913

Oh yeah, his phone number!
Damn it!

1573
01:19:09,592 --> 01:19:11,523
不就是開了點玩笑嗎

1574

Let us pray.

1579
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:23,123
We thank you, oh Lord, for
blessing us all so much.

1580
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:22,203
我們禱告

感謝天父施恩於我們

1582
01:19:23,623 --> 01:19:28,623
Everything we do is for You, Lord,
so please give us strength.

1583
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:29,243
但願離您更近一步

1584
01:19:29,243 --> 01:19:33,612
您以慈悲恩待我

1585
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:55,232
I got it! I figured out
how I can call you!

1586
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:58,233
我知道了 知道怎麼召喚你了

1587
01:19:57,622 --> 01:20:00,023
But still, couldn't you have called
me to a better place than this?

1588
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:03,443
那也不能在這裡召喚我出來啊

1589
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:04,932
Are you scared?

1590
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:06,812
I heard that Jesus and his
followers were good people.

1591
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:07,683
你怕了嗎

1592
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:08,462
Stop flattering them. Didn't you say
before that you didn't believe in them?

1593
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,512
聽說這位神很不錯呢

1594
01:20:08,462 --> 01:20:10,622
I came by just in case
they might be here.

1595
01:20:09,512 --> 01:20:11,283
不要奉承 你不是不相信有神嗎

1596
01:20:11,283 --> 01:20:13,753
或許會在這兒呢 所以過來看看

1597
01:20:15,632 --> 01:20:18,332
Why are you walking away instead of
disappearing with sparks and such?

1598
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:19,432
I can't do that here.

1599
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,923
為什麼不一下子消失 走著去啊

1600
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:21,932
Think of this as being
a kind of a dead zone for me.

1601
01:20:20,923 --> 01:20:22,063
在這裡不行

1602
01:20:21,932 --> 01:20:23,632
And don't follow me.

1603
01:20:22,063 --> 01:20:24,592
這裡類似非軍事區

1604
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:26,233
What are you planning to
do about my wish?

1605
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:26,063
不要跟著我

1606
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,632
None of the three things
that I wished for were taken care of.

1607
01:20:27,162 --> 01:20:29,003
我的願望 你打算怎麼辦

1608
01:20:28,632 --> 01:20:30,332
They'll be taken care of soon.
Same goes for your job.

1609
01:20:29,003 --> 01:20:30,972
三個當中有三個沒得到解決

1610
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:32,033
No, not that. I mean the thing
about me getting a boyfriend.

1611
01:20:30,972 --> 01:20:32,303
這次馬上就能解決了

1612
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,432
You'll have to try hard
to make that happen too!

1613
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:33,173
兼職也會

1614
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:34,602
不是那個 我是說男朋友

1615
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:36,772
那個需要你的努力

1616
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:41,133
You can't just leave things like this!

1617
01:20:41,413 --> 01:20:43,913
這樣對待我 你會後悔的

1618
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:46,033
I know how to summon him now.
I've got it now.

1619
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:46,782
我現在知道方法了

1620
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:48,882
算是拿到了電話號碼

1621
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:57,332
Oh, I didn't think that
this would work.

1622
01:20:57,332 --> 01:20:59,533
Why did you do it, then?

1623
01:20:57,632 --> 01:21:00,332
我以為這個不行呢

1624
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:01,933
Wait!

1625
01:21:00,332 --> 01:21:02,332
以為不行 為什麼還試

1626
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,173
等一等

1627
01:21:12,032 --> 01:21:13,932
Did you just latch onto me?

1628
01:21:14,842 --> 01:21:16,612
你抓住我了嗎

1629
01:21:15,932 --> 01:21:18,332
Oh, I can't hold on
much longer! That's hot!

1630
01:21:18,383 --> 01:21:19,823
啊 實在不行了

1631
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,332
I thought you'd be cold
since you were blue.

1632
01:21:19,823 --> 01:21:21,253
好燙啊

1633
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:24,152
我看是藍色的 以為涼呢

1634
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,033
Don't you know that blue fire
is the hottest kind of fire?

1635
01:21:25,893 --> 01:21:28,563
本來就是藍色火焰溫度更高 你這個文科生

1636
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:27,632
Why not study if you have
time to fool around like this?

1637
01:21:28,563 --> 01:21:30,292
有空玩耍 不如多學習

1638
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:33,332
You know, I've always been
at the top of my classes...

1639
01:21:31,063 --> 01:21:32,263
對哦

1640
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:36,333
我自幼父母雙亡 無依無靠也一直拿第一名...

1641
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:34,533
Oh, whatever.

1642
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:37,832
Can't you just give me money
instead of being a guardian angel

1643
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,633
算了

1644
01:21:37,633 --> 01:21:39,572
不要做什麼守護神

1645
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:38,832
and call it a day?

1646
01:21:38,832 --> 01:21:40,633
I have to go because I'm busy.

1647
01:21:39,572 --> 01:21:41,442
能不能給我500萬 把我打發掉

1648
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,033
What's got you so busy?

1649
01:21:41,442 --> 01:21:43,442
我有事得走了

1650
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,932
Well, your outfit is
a bit fancy, yes.

1651
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:44,942
什麼事

1652
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:46,633
Tomorrow's the death anniversary
of someone that I knew.

1653
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:47,313
打扮有些嚴肅哦

1654
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:48,332
So why are you heading
over there today?

1655
01:21:47,313 --> 01:21:49,382
明天是我認識的人的忌日

1656
01:21:48,332 --> 01:21:49,332
Is that person's grave
out in the countryside?

1657
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:51,633
In that place,
today is tomorrow.

1658
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:50,683
那你怎麼今天就去啊

1659
01:21:50,683 --> 01:21:51,612
是外地嗎

1660
01:21:51,612 --> 01:21:53,753
那個地方 今天是明天

1661
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:54,033
When are you coming back?
Tomorrow? The day after that?

1662
01:21:53,853 --> 01:21:55,222
那你什麼時候回來

1663
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:55,533
There's something
I really want to ask!

1664
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:56,652
明天 後天

1665
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:57,232
Hurry up and ask, then!

1666
01:21:56,652 --> 01:21:58,022
我有話問你呢

1667
01:21:58,022 --> 01:21:59,792
那快問吧

1668
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,633
I know that this is
a strange question, but

1669
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:05,033
I'd like for you to not
misunderstand and hear me out.

1670
01:22:02,733 --> 01:22:05,802
我知道我這麼問 你會覺得很荒唐

1671
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,633
All right, already,
so ask away. What?

1672
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:07,802
但請你不要誤會 認真聆聽

1673
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:09,333
When you first showed up,
I thought you may be a god of death.

1674
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:09,232
知道了 問吧 想問什麼

1675
01:22:09,232 --> 01:22:12,103
一開始 我以為你是地獄使者

1676
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:13,132
But you would have taken me away
as soon as you saw me if you were.

1677
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:16,073
但若是地獄使者 一見到我肯定會帶我走

1678
01:22:13,132 --> 01:22:16,733
And then, I thought that
you may just be a ghost.

1679
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:19,643
然後 我以為你是鬼

1680
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:20,733
But you have a shadow.

1681
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,412
可是叔叔你

1682
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:23,512
有影子

1683
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:26,733
So I thought long and hard
about what you might be.

1684
01:22:25,353 --> 01:22:26,883
所以 我想了想

1685
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,033
And? What's your conclusion?
What am I?

1686
01:22:26,883 --> 01:22:29,052
那位叔叔到底是什麼呢

1687
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,533
A goblin.

1688
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:30,592
那你說我是什麼

1689
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:32,253
鬼怪

1690
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,533
Are you a goblin, by any chance?

1691
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:36,763
叔叔 你是不是鬼怪啊

1692
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:40,832
Who are you?
Who are you, really?

1693
01:22:40,733 --> 01:22:42,573
你是什麼人

1694
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:43,133
It feels a bit awkward
for me to say, but...

1695
01:22:42,573 --> 01:22:43,302
你到底是什麼人

1696
01:22:43,302 --> 01:22:45,872
不好意思自己開口

1697
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:46,232
I'm the Goblin's Bride.

1698
01:22:46,772 --> 01:22:49,472
我是鬼怪新娘

1699
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:48,732
You know that I can see spirits, right?

1700
01:22:48,732 --> 01:22:51,133
I had this on me...

1701
01:22:49,843 --> 01:22:51,772
你知道我能看見鬼吧

1702
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:53,843
我一出生

1703
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:54,832
since I was born.

1704
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:58,932
I think it's because of this that ghosts
keep saying that I'm the Goblin's Bride.

1705
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:57,683
身上就有這個

1706
01:22:57,683 --> 01:22:59,823
可能是因為這個吧 所以那幫鬼

1707
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,633
You can see it, right?

1708
01:22:59,823 --> 01:23:01,553
都叫我是鬼怪新娘

1709
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,133
Right here.

1710
01:23:01,553 --> 01:23:03,353
看見了吧

1711
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:17,733
You can see it, right?

1712
01:23:18,603 --> 01:23:20,442
這個

1713
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:22,132
Prove it to me.

1714
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:24,612
證明一下吧

1715
01:23:24,152 --> 01:23:26,233
You want me to prove that
I'm the Goblin's Bride?

1716
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:27,432
Yeah.

1717
01:23:26,783 --> 01:23:29,042
讓我證明自己是鬼怪新娘啊

1718
01:23:28,432 --> 01:23:29,733
How do I do that?

1719
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,383
是的

1720
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:32,832
Do you want me to fly or something?

1721
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:32,553
怎麼證明

1722
01:23:32,553 --> 01:23:35,252
讓我 飛給你看看嗎

1723
01:23:32,832 --> 01:23:35,033
Or turn into a broomstick?

1724
01:23:35,252 --> 01:23:36,192
或者

1725
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:37,033
Do it.

1726
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:38,123
變成掃把嗎

1727
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:38,633
I'm being really serious right now.

1728
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:39,663
能做就做

1729
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:39,832
Me too.

1730
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:41,122
我是認真的

1731
01:23:39,832 --> 01:23:41,832
Tell me what you see
when you look at me.

1732
01:23:41,122 --> 01:23:42,733
我也是

1733
01:23:42,732 --> 01:23:44,332
Are you trying to get revenge on me?

1734
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,393
在我身上看到什麼 你都說說看

1735
01:23:44,332 --> 01:23:46,033
Tell me, already!
Tell me everything you see!

1736
01:23:45,493 --> 01:23:46,763
你這是報復我呀

1737
01:23:46,763 --> 01:23:48,933
說說看 你都看到了什麼

1738
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:52,232
You're tall.

1739
01:23:52,232 --> 01:23:53,332
And?

1740
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:54,943
個子很高

1741
01:23:54,432 --> 01:23:56,832
- Your clothes look expensive.
- And?

1742
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:56,413
還有呢

1743
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:58,443
衣服看起來很貴

1744
01:23:58,443 --> 01:23:59,783
還有呢

1745
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:01,933
You look like you're in
your mid-thirties.

1746
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:03,133
And?

1747
01:24:03,312 --> 01:24:04,713
大概是30歲中旬

1748
01:24:03,662 --> 01:24:08,333
You don't want me to tell you that
you're handsome or something, right?

1749
01:24:04,713 --> 01:24:06,183
還有呢

1750
01:24:06,183 --> 01:24:10,722
該不會是想讓我說你帥吧

1751
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,032
You needed to have
the answer that I want.

1752
01:24:10,722 --> 01:24:13,893
我想要的答案 你應該知道

1753
01:24:12,032 --> 01:24:17,062
But if that's all you can see,
you're not the Goblin's Bride.

1754
01:24:14,862 --> 01:24:17,393
如果你在我身上看到的就只有那些的話

1755
01:24:17,062 --> 01:24:19,033
You'd be of no use
to a goblin like this.

1756
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:19,662
那你不是鬼怪新娘

1757
01:24:19,662 --> 01:24:22,603
你對鬼怪沒有效用價值

1758
01:24:19,932 --> 01:24:21,632
I'm sorry that you see ghosts

1759
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,632
but you're not supposed to
be alive anyway, so be thankful.

1760
01:24:22,603 --> 01:24:24,433
能看見鬼 雖然很不幸

1761
01:24:24,433 --> 01:24:27,673
但你撿了一條命 還是感恩吧

1762
01:24:24,632 --> 01:24:29,432
You've already broken the rules
just by existing as a human being.

1763
01:24:27,673 --> 01:24:30,612
你只是我違背原則 插手人類的生死問題

1764
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:32,443
出現的副作用而已

1765
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:36,332
What if I don't want to be thankful?

1766
01:24:36,332 --> 01:24:38,633
Then you can just die
like you were supposed to.

1767
01:24:37,013 --> 01:24:38,883
如果我不願意接受呢

1768
01:24:38,883 --> 01:24:41,253
那就照你原來的命 去死也可以

1769
01:24:39,133 --> 01:24:40,432
You're so cruel.

1770
01:24:41,852 --> 01:24:43,823
這話說的...

1771
01:24:44,332 --> 01:24:45,932
Fine, then.

1772
01:24:45,932 --> 01:24:48,232
Let me ask you the same
thing I asked, one more time.

1773
01:24:47,222 --> 01:24:48,963
我知道了

1774
01:24:48,232 --> 01:24:51,932
Are you, by any chance, a goblin?

1775
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:50,693
我再問剛才那個問題

1776
01:24:50,693 --> 01:24:52,803
叔叔你是不是

1777
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:52,932
- No.
- You're not?

1778
01:24:52,932 --> 01:24:54,832
- I'm not.
- What are you, then?

1779
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:54,303
鬼怪啊

1780
01:24:54,303 --> 01:24:55,503
-不是
-不是啊

1781
01:24:55,503 --> 01:24:56,073
不是

1782
01:24:55,832 --> 01:24:59,232
Who are you to decide whether
you'll be with me or not?

1783
01:24:56,073 --> 01:24:57,873
那麼是什麼

1784
01:24:58,632 --> 01:25:02,003
到底是什麼 敢判斷我的價值

1785
01:24:59,232 --> 01:25:01,332
I thought you wanted your life
to change for the better.

1786
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:04,243
不是說處境變好一丁點也行嗎

1787
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:07,432
I'm just someone who cares just
a little bit about your crappy life.

1788
01:25:06,582 --> 01:25:10,383
對你可憐的處境 擔心那麼一丁點的人

1789
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:13,833
Tune into reality instead of letting
yourself be consumed by rumors.

1790
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:14,823
面對現實吧

1791
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:16,432
Because you're not the Goblin's Bride.

1792
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:17,092
不要聽信傳聞

1793
01:25:17,323 --> 01:25:19,692
因為你不是鬼怪新娘

1794
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,332
Wait!

1795
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:28,332
等一等

1796
01:25:29,632 --> 01:25:31,432
I'm not finished talking...

1797
01:25:32,203 --> 01:25:34,303
我還沒說完呢

1798
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:44,033
Did you just follow me
through that door?

1799
01:25:42,882 --> 01:25:44,253
你這是

1800
01:25:44,253 --> 01:25:46,782
從正門進來的嗎 跟著我

1801
01:25:44,432 --> 01:25:47,232
How... did you do that?

1802
01:25:48,483 --> 01:25:50,292
你是怎麼進來的

1803
01:25:49,332 --> 01:25:52,133
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed.

1804
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:53,832
And then I followed you, Mister...

1805
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:53,792
抓住門把手

1806
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,862
然後推

1807
01:25:54,862 --> 01:25:56,762
跟著叔叔...

1808
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,033
But what's with this place?

1809
01:25:57,033 --> 01:25:59,932
Hey, I just asked you a question.
How did you come through that door?

1810
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,503
這裡怎麼這個樣子

1811
01:25:59,503 --> 01:26:02,672
所以我不是在問你嗎 你是怎麼通過正門的

1812
01:25:59,932 --> 01:26:03,133
Oh, is this
Provence Village in Paju?

1813
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:06,703
啊 是坡州嗎 英語村那裡

1814
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,932
But still, this doesn't
seem quite right.

1815
01:26:05,932 --> 01:26:09,032
What's going on here?
Where is this place?

1816
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,442
不過 就算是那裡也不對啊

1817
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:10,112
這裡到底...怎麼回事啊

1818
01:26:09,032 --> 01:26:10,333
Canada.

1819
01:26:10,112 --> 01:26:11,743
這裡到底是哪兒啊

1820
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,632
Canada?

1821
01:26:11,743 --> 01:26:12,942
加拿大

1822
01:26:12,932 --> 01:26:15,032
Canada...

1823
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:15,112
加拿大啊

1824
01:26:15,532 --> 01:26:18,233
You mean, the place
with the maple leaf?

1825
01:26:15,853 --> 01:26:18,283
加拿大的話

1826
01:26:18,233 --> 01:26:19,832
The one in North America?

1827
01:26:18,283 --> 01:26:19,652
那個

1828
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:21,122
楓葉國

1829
01:26:19,832 --> 01:26:22,033
Is this really a different country?

1830
01:26:21,122 --> 01:26:22,552
北極光那裡嗎

1831
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:25,453
這裡...這裡真的是外國嗎

1832
01:26:29,932 --> 01:26:33,232
Wow. You can do this too?

1833
01:26:32,863 --> 01:26:36,272
大發 叔叔 你還有這種本事啊

1834
01:26:33,832 --> 01:26:36,432
You apparently can too.
Who are you, really?

1835
01:26:36,272 --> 01:26:37,702
你也有啊

1836
01:26:37,432 --> 01:26:41,133
If this really is Canada and
you really have the power to do this...

1837
01:26:37,702 --> 01:26:39,402
你到底是什麼人

1838
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:43,843
若這裡真的是加拿大 叔叔有這個本事

1839
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,633
I've made up my mind.

1840
01:26:43,843 --> 01:26:45,782
那我決定了

1841
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,232
- About what?
- I've made up my mind!

1842
01:26:46,232 --> 01:26:47,232
So, about what, exactly?

1843
01:26:47,013 --> 01:26:48,683
-決定什麼
-拿定主意了

1844
01:26:47,232 --> 01:26:48,633
I'll marry you, Mister!

1845
01:26:48,633 --> 01:26:52,232
Because no matter how I think about it,
I'm pretty sure that you're a goblin.

1846
01:26:48,683 --> 01:26:49,553
什...什麼

1847
01:26:49,553 --> 01:26:51,483
我要嫁給你

1848
01:26:51,483 --> 01:26:55,553
我總覺得 你肯定是鬼怪沒錯

1849
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:54,633
I love you!

1850
01:26:55,853 --> 01:26:57,422
我愛你

1851
01:27:25,182 --> 01:27:29,182

1866
01:28:01,632 --> 01:28:04,673
無論在哪兒
我都想讓她看到我知性 整潔的樣子

01:28:07,372 --> 01:28:09,243
誰答應做你新娘了呀

1875
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:10,912
小心戴帽子的男人
