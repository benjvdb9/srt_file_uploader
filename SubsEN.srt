00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:02,633
<i>If a spirit inhabits an object that has
the touch or the blood of a human on it</i>

5
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,933
<i>the spirit becomes a goblin.</i>

6
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,933
<i>And this was a sword
from a battlefield</i>

7
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,843
<i>with the blood of thousands on it</i>

8
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,023
<i>with even its own owner's blood on
it, so it was only to be expected.</i>

9
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>And only the bride of the goblin will
be able to pull out that sword.</i>

10
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,503
<i>And when the sword is pulled out</i>

11
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:48,323
<i>he will become nothing
once more, and rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,323
Of course, this is a cruel
deal for the goblin.

13
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,823
The goblin, which woke up
to realize that it is immortal

14
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,533
is everywhere and nowhere in
this world at the same time

15
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,423
and even now, nobody
knows where he may be...

16
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,633
Why the hell are you laughing, girl?

17
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:23,423
Are you about to tell me, "He's still
looking for his bride, and it's me"?

18
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,423
Even though I look like this now, I had
hordes of men following me in my prime!

19
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:32,423
Don't come back next time
only to be surprised to find me gone.

20
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,923
Wow, I'm so jealous.

21
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,423
I'm just getting old.

22
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,233
That's not something for me to
brag about in front of you, though.

23
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,823
Hey, that's not nice!

24
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:47,533
No, I'm not! I give you discounts
on spinach and cabbage!

25
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,033
The bastard who left you behind
and ran off is the not nice one here.

26
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,733
You do have a point.

27
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,033
But you know, that story is too sad.

28
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,323
Ha, sure.

29
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:03,123
It's really a romantic sort of curse.

30
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,923
I mean, he has to find
his bride in order to die.

31
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,133
God is cruel.

32
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,423
God has always been cruel.

33
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,533
And he's selfish and jealous too.

34
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,533
God only cares about himself.

35
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,133
He's just like another
guy we know, huh?

36
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,133
Well, I'll be going now.
I hope you sell a lot.

37
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,233
And you'd better be
here next time too, okay?

38
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,033
When you're in a position in which
your life is flashing before your eyes

39
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,923
pray for mercy
with all your heart.

40
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:45,733
<i>Because a god with a soft spot
may be listening to you.</i>

41
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,323
<i>[PARIS, 1968]</i>

42
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,533
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

43
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,033
If you run away from home now, you'll
live with worse people than that.

44
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,233
And you'll never see
your mother again.

45
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,123
Who the hell are you?
Are you Korean?

46
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,033
I'm a more complicated person
than you'd think.

47
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,733
It's your turn now.

48
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,333
Go and tell him clearly

49
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,733
"You've adopted me, so you're my father.
So you have to raise me well."

50
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,833
And ask your mother for help too.
And tell her you're in pain.

51
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,123
What kind of bull are you spouting?
Get the hell out of my way!

52
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,333
And slitting your wrist like
that won't kill you

53
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,833
but it'll render your hand
useless, so be aware of that.

54
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,333
Who are you?

55
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,123
Don't avoid his gaze
and speak clearly.

56
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,423
Can you do that?

57
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:41,233
And what if he beats me to death?
Will you take responsibility?

58
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,833
That's why I broke his rib for you.

59
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,733
You little bastard!

60
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,623
That's lunch for you.

61
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,833
Go to school
after you're done talking to him.

62
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,233
The answer for number 17
on the math quiz isn't 2. It's 4.

63
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,533
You got that question wrong, so...

64
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,833
Who... are you, really?

65
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:20,923
<i>He's water, wind, and fire.</i>

66
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,623
<i>Light and darkness.</i>

67
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,833
<i>And at one time...</i>

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,123
<i>he was human.</i>

69
00:05:49,147 --> 00:06:01,147


70
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,033
<i>His subjects called him "God."</i>

71
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:17,123
<i>He cut down his foes
covered in crimson blood</i>.

72
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:22,123
<i>And he was a military man
through and through.</i>

73
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:35,123
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

74
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:43,833
- Hooray for the general!
- Hooray for the general!

75
00:08:54,933 --> 00:09:00,433
Step aside! It's the great
General Kim Shin!

76
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,123
Kim Shin will take off his armor
and heed the king's royal decree.

77
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,523
I dare you to say
that again, punk!

78
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:12,623
How dare some political
lackey like you oppose...

79
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:16,123
The criminal Kim Shin will
take off his armor and...

80
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,623
How dare you!

81
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,023
I heard you loud and clear.
Wait there.

82
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,733
Happy now?

83
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,733
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees

84
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,933
and heed the king's royal decree.

85
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,333
I'll pull that rotten tongue
of yours right out!

86
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,733
"Criminal Kim Shin"?
Are you out of your damn mind?

87
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,123
Are you insane?

88
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,623
General.

89
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:02,333
Criminal Kim Shin, put down your
sword and get on your knees...

90
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,123
I'm going to see the king.
Get out of my way.

91
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,933
- Criminal Kim Shin...
- If you don't move, you'll surely die.

92
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,733
Step aside.

93
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,833
You bastards!

94
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,733
These men fought
for three straight nights!

95
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,523
They were just on their way
back from that hell!

96
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:49,123
So how dare you...
how dare you bastards!

97
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:52,333
Open the castle gates!

98
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,933
Stay here and watch over the men.

99
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,933
I'll be right back.

100
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:42,333
They say that he's like a king among
the people and regarded as a god.

101
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,833
And his name is Kim Shin.

102
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,833
<i>That man's endless ascension to power
is making the citizens rise up</i>

103
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>and his power makes a mockery
of the royal family's authority.</i>

104
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,733
So please, issue him the harshest
punishment you can under the law.

105
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,523
<i>He was able to see the blades
of his opponents quite well</i>

106
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>but he'd been blind to the young
king's fear and jealousy toward him.</i>

107
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,523
<i>And he was unaware of the fact</i>

108
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:28,833
<i>that the king's jealousy and fear were
sharper than any blade he'd known.</i>

109
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,023
So he's really going this far?

110
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,833
Don't step any closer.

111
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,123
Stop right there.

112
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,023
Stop all of it.

113
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:48,733
Stop right there and die.
If you do, I'll spare everyone else.

114
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,833
But if you take even one
more step toward me

115
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:56,933
I'll kill everyone in front of you
and lay their corpses at your feet.

116
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,833
Go, General.

117
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:09,433
I'm all right.

118
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,023
I...

119
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:15,933
Your Highness, I...

120
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,233
I know.

121
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,523
I know everything.

122
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:26,833
And if this is the end for me,
then such is my fate.

123
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,023
So please, go.

124
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,933
Don't stop, and keep
walking toward the king.

125
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:55,957


126
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,733
Don't spare her
or anyone related to her!

127
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,233
This is my command!

128
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,623
Stop!

129
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,833
What are you doing?
Bring the criminal to his knees!

130
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,023
General!

131
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,333
Your Highness!
How could you do this?

132
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,833
Have you no fear of the heavens?

133
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,023
It's not like the heavens
have ever taken your side.

134
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,733
Having that sinner's gaze
upon us is making me dizzy.

135
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,523
Strike him down now!

136
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,733
This doesn't concern you.

137
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,933
General! General!

138
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:52,523
I want to make
a final request of you.

139
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,333
To think that such a day would come.

140
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,523
Forgive me, sir.

141
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,523
I'll be right behind you, sir.

142
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,823
Nobody may retrieve
this criminal's body.

143
00:16:55,823 --> 00:17:00,733
Leave it out on the fields to be
consumed by wild animals!

144
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:07,523
Such is the only fitting punishment
for a criminal such as him.

145
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,433
This is a royal decree!

146
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:04,523
- Please have mercy, God!
- Please, spare him!

147
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:31,023
<i>Don't pray to anyone or anything.</i>

148
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,523
<i>Because the gods aren't listening.</i>

149
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:42,323
<i>And on that clear,
sunny afternoon...</i>

150
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,523
<i>he died by the very
blade that he'd wielded.</i>

00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,523
Ow, damn it!
You crazy bastard!

154
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,823
Are your eyes only there
for decoration?

155
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,933
You have a death... wish...

156
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,433
Hey, what's with you, bastard?

157
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,523
A wild boar.

158
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,823
What?

159
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,523
You struck a wild boar
with your car.

160
00:20:49,547 --> 00:21:01,547


161
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,933
Are you all right, sir?
Do you want me to call the authorities?

162
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:10,353
I just hit a wild boar, you see...

163
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,073
so, um, a wild boar
came out of nowhere!

164
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,873
A wild boar?
In the middle of Gangnam?

165
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,873
It's... it's a person!

166
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,673
Oh my gosh, what do we do?

167
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,573
Hello? This is 911, right?

168
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,373
I'm at the Yeoksang
four-way intersection.

169
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:31,073
There's a woman in the trunk of
a car here! I think she may be dead.

170
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,173
I'm not sure.
She's not moving. Yes.

171
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,673
I'm not sure about that. I just happened
to come across this car accident...

00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,373
I'm not sure what's going on.
You should hurry and come.

173
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,373
Yes.

174
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,273
Why am I...
why am I there?

175
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,353
Hwang Mi Young.
25 years old.

176
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:51,073
Born in the year of the ox
on March 1st.

177
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:55,873
Time of death is 08:32 on Friday.

178
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,173
That's the information
I have on the deceased.

179
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,573
That's you, right?

180
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:31,273
Drink it. It'll make you forget about
what happened to you in this life.

181
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:48,873
What happens if I don't drink this?

182
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,473
You'll come to regret it.

183
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:55,373
I hope that you will leave your
regrets behind with this life.

184
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,673
A goblin?

185
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,673
A god of death?

186
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,373
That's quite a vulgar
disguise he has on.

187
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:57,573
Your Lordship!

188
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,073
It's been 20 years
since I've last seen you.

189
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,673
Have you been well for
all those years, sir?

190
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,573
Have you been well?

191
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,973
Well, I've aged quite a bit, sir.

192
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:21,073
But you're looking
as brilliant as ever.

193
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,673
He doesn't look that cool to me.

194
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,873
You punk!

195
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,873
This is my grandson.
The one that I've told you about.

196
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:33,373
Greet him properly.

197
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,073
Who is this guy?

198
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:38,173
So you're Duk Hwa.

199
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:43,873
I'm someone who'll be your uncle, your
brother, your son, then your grandson.

200
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,873
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

201
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,373
What does that even mean?

202
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,573
You seem weirder and weirder
by the minute, Mister.

203
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,173
You brat!

204
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:57,473
Oh, I offer my deepest apologies, sir.

205
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,573
He's an only child
and was quite spoiled, you see.

206
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,173
But you...

207
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,973
Me? What about me?

208
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:14,973
There was a boy who was born in this land
but was laid to rest in another country.

209
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,473
You're his descendant.

210
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,173
And you look just like him.

211
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,773
Which part, exactly?

212
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,873
Was that ancestor of mine handsome?

213
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,773
Duk Hwa!

214
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:31,873
I have no idea how such an insolent child
came to be. My apologies, Your Lordship.

215
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:36,373
Worry not.
You've never disappointed anyone.

216
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:37,473
But you know, Uncle.

217
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,973
Why do you keep using
informal speech toward Grandpa?

218
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,173
Do you have a death wish
or something?

219
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,173
Why, you little!

220
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,673
Oh my...

221
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,973
<i>Your Lordship.</i>

222
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:57,873
I offer my deepest apologies
for coming to see you so late.

223
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:03,973
I've been sick all this
time, Your Lordship.

224
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:13,773
I must feel the same way
that your blade does, sir.

225
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:22,373
From this moment on, this child
will serve you, Your Lordship.

226
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,873
This is my grandson.

227
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:29,373
This sword is "Your Lordship," Grandpa?

228
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,973
<i>It seems that your subjects
have saved your soul.</i>

229
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:51,573
<i>However, your blade
is stained with blood.</i>

230
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:58,673
<i>They may have been your enemies,
but they were the gods' creations.</i>

231
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:04,973
<i>So you will be immortal and alone,
watching your loved ones die before you.</i>

232
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:08,173
<i>Not a single one of those deaths
will be wiped from your memory.</i>

233
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:15,073
<i>This blessing is the punishment
that I am giving to you.</i>

234
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:25,673
<i>And only the Goblin's Bride will be
able to remove that blade.</i>

235
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:31,073
<i>And when she does, you'll be able to
return to nothingness and rest in peace.</i>

236
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,773
Your Lordship!

237
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:43,173
There is a place
where I must go.

238
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,573
Who goes there?

239
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,473
How dare you come into
a place like this?

240
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,473
Hey, you insolent...

241
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,573
Y-you... are...

242
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:48,073
I was too late, it seems.

243
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,173
Grandpa! Grandpa!

244
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:06,173
Grandpa!

245
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:26,173
It seems...

246
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,373
that this is the first punishment
that I am receiving.

247
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:38,573
Please... accept me.

248
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,773
As of this moment,
I will serve you.

249
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,873
That was my grandfather's final wish.

250
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,173
I became blinded
by my desire for revenge...

251
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:08,673
and couldn't even ask your
grandfather how he'd been.

252
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,173
And yet...

253
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,073
you wish to serve me?

254
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:58,097


255
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:03,133
It's quite nice to be able to enjoy
a view like this at my leisure.

256
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,323
And I'm happy that you can enjoy
a view like this at your leisure.

257
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,823
Here.

258
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:36,323
You should have it, Your Lordship.
I'm still quite full.

259
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,523
How is it that you're full
when you've had nothing to eat?

260
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,133
I'm tiny, so I get full even after
eating the tiniest morsel of food.

261
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,323
You're much bigger than I am, sir,
so please eat that instead.

262
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:51,523
We can do this, then.

263
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,933
We're still quite
far from land, sir.

264
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,823
Neither of us will be full
if we share this.

265
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,783
So is that why
you're insisting on starving?

266
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:05,433
I'm a child, so I can go around
to beg for food if I get hungry.

267
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:09,293
Do you think I brought you with me
just to have you go around begging?

268
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,933
Trust me.

269
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:14,723
I may be an even greater
person than you imagine.

270
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,223
Come, now.

271
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,933
Wow!

272
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:40,723
Wow!

273
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:54,223
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!

274
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,723
Can I peek in that bag of yours?

275
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,923
We need to decrease
the weight on this boat, you see.

276
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,133
Your Lordship.
Your Lordship!

277
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,923
Put that child down now.

278
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,223
If you do, I'll let you keep
your life at the very least.

279
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:13,223
It's clear there's someone among us who's
at fault for the waves being unruly.

280
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,423
I'll sell you as a slave,
so give me your hands and feet!

281
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,923
And as for this squirt,
throw him overboard.

282
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,923
Do you know what happens to
humans who are lesser than animals?

283
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,423
They meet the God of Wrath.

284
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,423
H-h-he's a goblin!

285
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,023
Please, spare us!

286
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:26,923
It's too late.

287
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,323
It sure is nice to be back
here at my leisure.

288
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,923
Why? Why did you do that?

289
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,623
<i>If there is a god, please...</i>

290
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,523
<i>please, save me.</i>

291
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,233
<i>Please, save me.</i>

292
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,733
<i>Just anybody, please. Save me!</i>

293
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,623
Who are you?

294
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,123
I'm "just anybody."

295
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:42,233
Please... please, help me.

296
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,423
Well, I don't know.

297
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,323
It's my rule not to get involved
in human beings' lives.

298
00:39:55,323 --> 00:40:01,733
I... really can't
just die like this.

299
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:09,233
The one you're asking me
to save isn't you, is it?

300
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,823
Just my child, at least. Please.

301
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:46,623
You're lucky, though, to have
met a soft-hearted god like me.

302
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:50,923
It's just that I don't want
to see anyone die tonight.

303
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,033
<i>[JI YEON HEE. 27 YEARS OLD. BORN IN
THE YEAR OF THE TIGER ON MARCH 1ST.]</i>

304
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:03,643
<i>[NO NAME. ZERO YEARS OLD.]</i>

305
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,923
Snow, and rain, and...

306
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,423
flowers, eh?

307
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>- The Goblin's Bride is back.
- The Goblin's Bride is back.</i>

308
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,323
<i>[EIGHT YEARS LATER]</i>

309
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:22,733
What do you want for your
birthday this year, Eun Tak?

310
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,623
Round rice cakes?
Square rice cakes?

311
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:30,623
Mom. Can't I have a party now
instead of Korean-style parties?

312
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,923
What's the difference?

313
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,323
Well, a cake instead of
rice cakes, for one.

314
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,923
I want to blow out candles
and make a wish too.

315
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,733
I think the reason why my
wish isn't coming true is because

316
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,423
I've been making my wishes on rice
cakes instead of birthday candles.

317
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,733
Oh, I didn't realize!

318
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,123
I only got you rice cakes
because you like them!

319
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,233
All right, then. Let's throw you
a party with cake from now on.

320
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,923
Wow! You're the best, Mom!

321
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:55,923
Oh, it's a puppy!

322
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:57,023
Huh? A puppy?

323
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,233
Look at this.
It's spring again.

324
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,923
Isn't that fascinating?

325
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:27,947


326
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:29,923
Ah, I'm so tired.

327
00:44:29,923 --> 00:44:32,623
Mom, I got a 100 on
my English quiz today!

328
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,733
I'm super-duper tired because
I used so much brainpower today!

329
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,123
Oh, really?

330
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,623
Wow! It's cake!

331
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:43,233
Are we going to have
a party now, Mom?

332
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:47,623
Yeah. Come and sit.
Light the candles.

333
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,423
Is it okay for me to light them?

334
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,923
You can do it since you're
all grown up now, Eun Tak.

335
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,523
Oh yeah.
I'm nine years old now.

336
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:59,123
I even got a 100 on my English
quiz, so this is a cakewalk.

337
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:01,323
Where did you learn that saying?

338
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,123
You don't need to know, Mom.

339
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:07,233
I'm just good at picking up these
things from all sorts of people.

340
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:10,423
I think I might be a genius...

341
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:16,023
What's the matter?
You have to make a wish.

342
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,323
Happy birthday, my little pup!

343
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,023
It's not really you, Mom.

344
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:29,123
It's your spirit that
I'm talking to, isn't it?

345
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:37,123
So... you really can see
everything, can't you?

346
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:42,323
I was hoping that you
wouldn't be able to.

347
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,233
Are you dead, Mom?

348
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:55,023
Really?

349
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,923
Where are you, Mom?
Where are you now?

350
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:07,623
At Sageori Hospital.

351
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:20,733
You'll be getting
a call from the hospital.

352
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,523
And when you get there,
your aunt will arrive soon.

353
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:27,023
It's cold at night, so make
sure you have a scarf on.

354
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:30,123
Ask the granny at the supermarket
to go with you too. Okay?

355
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,323
You know how to get to
her place, right?

356
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:38,323
Go down the alleyway next to
the dry cleaners and then make a right.

357
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:40,623
Oh, you're so clever,
my little pup!

358
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:48,423
Don't ever look another spirit
in the eye from now on, okay?

359
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:53,623
I'm sorry, Mom, that I can see spirits.

360
00:46:55,023 --> 00:47:01,523
But it's because I can see spirits
that I can see you now.

361
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,733
I'm okay, Mom.

362
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,243
Okay.

363
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,523
Thank you so much...

364
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,623
for seeing me like this.

365
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:27,523
I... I think that
I have to go now.

366
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,523
I love you, my little pup.

367
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:39,823
Me too.
I love you too, Mom.

368
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:43,823
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

369
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:48,823
You have to go to heaven, okay?

370
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,533
You have to!

371
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,823
Mom!

372
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,133
Mom!

373
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,533
<i>Hello? Is this
Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home?</i>

374
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,723
<i>This is Sageori Jaeil
Hospital, and...</i>

375
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:36,823
I know.
I'll head over there.

376
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,923
I'm not going to make a wish.

377
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,323
I'm not going to make
even a single wish.

378
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,323
Nobody ever grants
them for me anyway.

379
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,133
So who would I even
make the wish to?

380
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:34,923
How is it that you never
seem to grow old, Granny?

381
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:38,533
How could I possibly get
any older than this?

382
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,923
You do have a point.

383
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:51,633
Can't you check up on my Eun Tak
every once in a while?

384
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,133
Spouting such nonsense again.

385
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,133
Why would I check up
on your daughter?

386
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,923
Just every once in a while!

387
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,633
Give her some leftover
cabbage if you have any

388
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,633
and some spinach, too.

389
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,423
You should've just died then. Why did you
have to ask them to give you more time?

390
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,903
You're so mean.

391
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,533
You're the one who told me
to plead with them with all my heart.

392
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,823
And you actually believed that?

393
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,323
And thanks to that, I got to live
for a bit longer before I had to go.

394
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,633
Thanks for everything, Granny.

395
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,423
I came to say goodbye.

396
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:40,423
I'm... going now.

397
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:10,447


398
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,533
Who are you, Mister?

399
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:24,823
You... can see me?

400
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,323
Oh, my scarf. I didn't put it on.
Mom's going to yell at me.

401
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,223
You have it on already, though.

402
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,423
This is Ms. Ji Yeon Hee's home, right?

403
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:38,823
I came here since her spirit
wasn't at the hospital.

404
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:44,633
But how is a child like you, who wasn't
supposed to have been born...

405
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:50,863
??

406
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,533
Did you, by any chance,
become nine years old this year?

407
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,633
I can't hear your voice
at all, Mister.

408
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:04,223
What brings you here, ma'am?

409
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,533
Go. And leave this child alone.

410
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:09,923
Granny!

411
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:17,223
You're getting in the way of my work.

412
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:19,133
As if.

413
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,923
Why are you trying to take her now
when it's already been so long?

414
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:23,133
I'm glad for this chance.
Better late than never.

415
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:24,723
I have no time right now.

416
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,533
That's your problem.

417
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,723
Do you have this child's
name on your list?

418
00:52:28,723 --> 00:52:32,533
She had no name back then,
but she has a name now.

419
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:36,133
If you have a certificate with
her name on it, hand it over.

420
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,723
I'll hand her over if you do.

421
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:41,823
If I'm going to get that, I need to get
nine years' worth of evidence on her.

422
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:43,633
You, of all people, should know...

423
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:57,033
I'll be seeing you again, child.

424
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:06,033
Granny! Mom is...

425
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:08,923
I know. And we can't
do anything about that.

426
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,133
But you have to live.

427
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:14,323
You have to move within three days
if you don't want him to find you.

428
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:18,923
You've looked a God of Death in the
eye, so you can't live here any longer.

429
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:21,723
He won't be able to
find me if I move?

430
00:53:21,723 --> 00:53:23,423
No, he won't.

431
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:25,633
That's why land is so important.

432
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:34,823
After midnight, a man and two women
will come for you at the funeral parlor.

433
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:36,723
Go with them.

434
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:44,823
It'll be hard on you,
but you have no other choice.

435
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,923
But why are you telling
me all of this?

436
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,133
Because I've taken a liking to you.

437
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,423
When she was pregnant with you...

438
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,533
she was so happy.

439
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:07,423
Here. A birthday gift.

440
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,133
<i>[10 YEARS LATER]</i>

441
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,133
Excuse me.

442
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:22,323
Want to get a drink with me?

443
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,323
Sure.

444
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:32,723
<i>This card worked up until
yesterday, but now it doesn't!</i>

445
00:55:32,723 --> 00:55:34,423
<i>So, um, Uncle.</i>

446
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,633
<i>There are some unfriendly
guys in suits at the bar.</i>

447
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:42,133
<i>I'm, um, with those people right now.</i>

448
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,423
<i>So please, pick up the phone!</i>

449
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,423
<i>They asked for your cell phone number</i>

450
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:49,823
<i>and got really unfriendly when
I told them that you don't have one.</i>

451
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,823
<i>Uncle. Are you listening?</i>

452
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:57,133
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

453
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,533
<i>Uncle!</i>

454
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,723
She still eats by herself even
though it's the end of senior year.

455
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,133
If you feel that bad for her,
go and eat with her yourself.

456
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,923
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

457
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:12,633
That girl sees spirits!

458
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,323
I'm more scared of her
than I am of ghosts.

459
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:16,723
At least you can't see ghosts.

460
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:21,533
Look. She can hear everything we're
saying, but she's acting as if she can't.

461
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,923
Hey.

462
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:41,033
Hey, I heard that
you're the Goblin's Bride.

463
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:44,533
Come on, I know you can see me.

464
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,323
Come with me.
It's just that I'm so lonely!

465
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:49,323
Please?

466
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,533
Hey, why do you keep ignoring me?

467
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:56,133
You evil girl!

468
00:56:57,223 --> 00:56:58,923
Oh, geez!

469
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:02,133
See? I knew you could see me.

470
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:11,923
Wait, so it's true?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

471
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:17,823
What was that? Why did she
apologize all of the sudden?

472
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:13,223
You didn't even turn on
any of the lights, Your Lordship.

473
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:16,483
I was lost in my thoughts.

474
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:22,123
These are the materials you
requested of me from the NIS.

475
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:30,303
Then...

476
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,723
Yes. It's happened, Your Lordship.

477
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:39,323
Duk Hwa is already 25 years old now.

478
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:44,723
I've pulled a lot of strings so you can
leave near the end of the month.

479
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,723
If you leave now, Your Lordship...

480
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,623
this will be the last time in
my lifetime I'll see you, correct?

481
01:00:05,193 --> 01:00:09,533
I thank you for every second
that we've shared together.

482
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,823
Duk Hwa will be here
when you return, sir.

483
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:25,083
I've been losing my keys
all the time lately

484
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,593
so I've had the lock
changed to a keyless one.

485
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,023
Grandpa! Uncle Shin!

486
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:37,383
There you are, Uncle Shin.
I begged you to come and pick me up.

487
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:39,293
But here you are.

488
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,043
Do not interrupt an adults' conversation!

489
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,523
Did you cancel my card?

490
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,573
You canceled my card, didn't you!

491
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:49,333
Yeah, I canceled it, you brat.

492
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:52,813
Ugh, I was totally humiliated!
Do you know how tough she was to get to?

493
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,143
Why did you even make me your heir
if you were going to treat me like this?

494
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,193
Uncle Shin, are you going somewhere?

495
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:06,913
- Where are you going?
- I told you to speak with more respect!

496
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,223
Stay out of this, Grandpa.

497
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:12,533
Is it about that thing again?
About you looking for your bride?

498
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:15,833
Why can't you just say that you're
leaving to get married somewhere?

499
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,833
Why can't you say it!

500
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,453
You're saying this kid will be here
when I return?

501
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:26,443
Uncle Shin, exactly when
and what time are you leaving?

502
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:10,467


503
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,713
One male and two females!
Your breakfast is ready.

504
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:19,613
I said, your breakfast is ready.

505
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:23,503
Shut up, you loudmouth.

506
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:26,803
Why are you blabbering so much over
the stupid breakfast you cooked?

507
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,233
What's with the seaweed soup?
Is it someone's birthday today?

508
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,723
Are you kidding me? Did she make the soup
because it's her birthday or something?

509
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,263
Yeah, it is.

510
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:40,243
How can she be proud of having killed her
own mom just to be born on this day?

511
01:02:40,243 --> 01:02:42,463
She's shameless because
she doesn't know any better.

512
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,883
Whatever she learned, she got it from you
since she's been with us for 10 years.

513
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,563
Shut up and eat your food.

514
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:51,083
Thanks for wishing me a happy birthday.

515
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:56,263
This is why people say that
you should never take in a stray.

516
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:58,023
Being too compassionate is my downfall.

517
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:02,073
I'm the pitiful one here since
I've raised her in her mother's stead.

518
01:03:02,073 --> 01:03:04,603
Your words are a bit harsh.

519
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,433
How is it harsh?

520
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,413
She may be your mom,
but she's my older sister.

521
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:11,563
Exactly. She and I are closer in
both heart and connection.

522
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:15,093
- Do you even know what you're saying?
- Shut up and eat your food.

523
01:03:15,093 --> 01:03:17,483
Where are you running off to?

524
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:20,283
I'm not running off anywhere.
I'm going to school.

525
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:30,053
You're dead if you touch those umbrellas.

526
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,513
Meet me at the bank
with your bankbook after school.

527
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:34,593
You know what will happen
if you don't, right?

528
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:38,223
How many times have I told you
that I don't have a bankbook?

529
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:47,443
Then where's the bankbook?
Where's your mom's insurance money?

530
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,993
How would I know that?

531
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:58,673
You took all the money for yourself!
You even took the money from our house!

532
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:02,693
Why is she talking
so much crap this morning?

533
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:05,623
Just shut up and bring it
unless you want to get your ass beaten.

534
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:07,933
The bankbook disappears whenever
I need to go to the bank

535
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,163
and who else could it be but you?

536
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,813
I'm telling you that
the bitch is possessed.

537
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:15,233
That's right.
There's a ghost right behind you.

538
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,793
What! You crazy bitch!

539
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:29,773
<i>My lordship.</i>

540
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:34,173
Will you be traveling alone
this time too?

541
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,523
Yes, it would seem so.

542
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:41,283
No women I've ever met has been
able to see the sword.

543
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,613
Which is of a great relief to me.

544
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:50,643
I hope the bride appears quickly for you
when you're in agony over the sword.

545
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:55,323
But if the sword is seen,
I hope no one finds out about it.

546
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:59,493
That's just human greed, I guess.

547
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:03,973
It's a relief for me too.

548
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:09,733
To still have you by my side,
and a full drink in my hand besides.

549
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:13,313
For tonight at least,
I'd like to remain alive.

550
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,633
Shall we drink to that?

551
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:54,053
When I was nine years old,
I told myself that I'd never do this.

552
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,333
But I'm desperate right now,
so I hope you understand.

553
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,883
Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives

554
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:06,083
and please help me find a boyfriend!

555
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,063
<i>Please help me find a job,
do something about my relatives</i>

556
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,843
and help me improve my pathetic life.

557
01:07:16,843 --> 01:07:18,883
Even 100 won in my pocket
would be fine! Please.

558
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,863
What in the world am I doing?

559
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:28,033
Who am I even praying to?

560
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,493
There is no god.

561
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:47,113
You're seriously not going to
make it rain right now, are you?

562
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:50,673
It's not even the rainy season!

563
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:53,473
Will the rain even stop?
Will it ever?

564
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:58,993
Why do you keep making it rain when
I don't even have an umbrella of my own?

565
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:03,733
- Was it you?
- Oh my goodness.

566
01:08:07,073 --> 01:08:08,943
Me?

567
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:17,863
Me?

568
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,913
- Were you talking to me?
- Yeah, you.

569
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:23,913
Was it you?

570
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,623
- What about me?
- Were you the one who summoned me?

571
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:30,283
- Me? I didn't summon you.
- You did summon me.

572
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:33,423
- But just how did you summon me?
- How would I have summoned you?

573
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:37,003
- I seriously didn't summon you.
- You definitely did summon me.

574
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:40,563
- Try to remember how you summoned me.
- Desperately?

575
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:46,983
I didn't summon you.
I'm just able to see you.

576
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:50,593
Because we accidentally locked eyes
when we passed each other the other day.

577
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:53,213
You're him, aren't you?

578
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:57,013
- What do you mean, you can see me?
- You're a ghost, aren't you?

579
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:59,483
I'm able to see ghosts.

580
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:02,563
- I'm not a ghost.
- That's what they all say at first.

581
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:07,663
Who are you?

582
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,333
Why can't you see what you
should see right in front of you?

583
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:14,123
- What am I supposed to see?
- Your twenties, thirties... your future.

584
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:17,113
Maybe because there is no future for me.

585
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:23,353
Were you a shaman or something
before you died? Or a con man?

586
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:27,613
- My future, my butt.
- What? A con, what?

587
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:31,743
Go to the light.
Wandering around for too long isn't good.

588
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:37,923
- What's with those flowers?
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

589
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,563
Okay, leave.

590
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:41,633
They're buckwheat flowers.

591
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:46,433
But that's not what I'm asking.
Why are you holding those flowers?

592
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:49,663
Give them to me.
They don't really suit you.

593
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,713
I've never been told that before.
I've seriously never been told that.

594
01:09:55,293 --> 01:09:57,483
You can just give them to me.

595
01:09:57,483 --> 01:10:00,223
It's my birthday today.

596
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,393
A very depressing birthday.

597
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:19,233
I get nothing but weeds for my birthday.

598
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:22,433
I got a napa cabbage
for my ninth birthday.

599
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:27,863
But what is the meaning
of these buckwheat flowers?

600
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:29,823
Lovers.

601
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:52,847


602
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:57,233
Why were you crying?

603
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,593
Job, relatives, or boyfriend?
Which of the three were you crying over?

604
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,343
- How did you know that?
- I heard you.

605
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,463
What do you mean, you heard it?

606
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,803
- I grant some people their wishes.
- You grant people their wishes?

607
01:11:13,593 --> 01:11:17,773
Like a magic genie?
Or a guardian angel?

608
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:21,243
Are you serious?
I knew it.

609
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:25,493
I knew you were different from other
ghosts from the moment I first saw you.

610
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:28,673
- Are you really my guardian angel?
- I didn't say I was your guardian angel.

611
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:33,773
My mom once told me that everyone is born
with their own life dictionary.

612
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:41,553
And in my dictionary, words such as
"Luck" or "Fortune" don't exist.

613
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:47,393
- You know what I mean, right?
- No, I don't.

614
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,203
I'm asking if I can have
about five million.

615
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:56,073
If getting me the cash is too tough,
then tell me the winning lottery numbers.

616
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:59,643
Go and say goodbye to your family.
You won't get to see them for a while.

617
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,813
Keep looking for a job at a chicken
restaurant. You'll find something soon.

618
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:11,903
Hey! What about my boyfriend?

619
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:14,973
Hello? Hey!

620
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:18,033
Ugh, what a poor sport!

621
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:35,133
- I haven't met you before.
- Likewise.

622
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,473
But I have heard rumors.

623
01:12:37,473 --> 01:12:40,313
There are all sorts of rumors about me.

624
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,403
What are you doing in my home?

625
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:43,773
You live here?

626
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:47,523
All the furniture you see is included,
so you just need to move in...

627
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,503
When did you get home, Uncle Shin?

628
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,583
- Explain.
- The thing is...

629
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,693
this house is going to sit vacant
for like 20 years.

630
01:12:56,693 --> 01:13:02,543
I thought about the money we could make
by charging someone monthly rent...

631
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:05,073
Do you even know what that is?
That thing over there is...

632
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:07,243
Don't refer to our new tenant as "that"!

633
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,983
He owns tea houses.

634
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:13,693
I'm sorry, I apologize.
My uncle is socially awkward.

635
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:15,633
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

636
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:22,653
- He hasn't paid yet.
- I saw the new car out front.

637
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,143
- It's the new tenant's car.
- It's not my car.

638
01:13:25,143 --> 01:13:26,903
And I've already given all my money...

639
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,003
to him.

640
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,053
Then I'll give you your money back,
so leave.

641
01:13:33,053 --> 01:13:38,353
I know you'd give me my money back,
but I've already signed the papers.

642
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:46,803
- I hope that wasn't very important.
- That was just a copy.

643
01:13:46,803 --> 01:13:48,823
The real estate agent has the original
and my stuff will be here tomorrow.

644
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:50,623
I don't have any plans tomorrow.

645
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:54,323
If you're done with your coffee, leave.
My hospitality ends here.

646
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:55,643
Go and pack your bags.

647
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:57,833
If you're leaving for the next 20 years,
then you should start packing now.

648
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,133
You really want to start with a goblin?

649
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,773
I'm sure you're aware of what it means
to sign a contract with the grim reaper.

650
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,513
How about I take that young boy
instead of this house, then?

651
01:14:09,683 --> 01:14:12,573
Nothing else I can do.
Use one of the many empty rooms.

652
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,523
- Make yourself at home.
- It is my home.

653
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:15,623
No, it's my house.

654
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:20,563
If you think you can kick a goblin out of
his own turf, then give it your best try.

655
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:41,133
This is not the nice dinner
I had envisioned for myself.

656
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:44,313
It's like a horrible restaurant that
I've only heard rumors about.

657
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,403
My bad.

658
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:57,353
I was trying to get my soup.

659
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:05,253
My bad this time.

660
01:15:06,163 --> 01:15:08,513
I was trying to get you.

661
01:15:08,513 --> 01:15:11,553
- "You"?
- I thought we had settled that earlier.

662
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,673
This. That. Hey. You.

663
01:15:41,233 --> 01:15:43,473
Lovers?

664
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:54,803
Lovers... what a joke.

665
01:16:13,923 --> 01:16:16,073
Hello.

666
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:17,103
Are you the owner?

667
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:20,133
My name is Ji Eun Tak.

668
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:25,903
I have a very upbeat
and positive attitude

669
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:28,973
so I can do any and every type of work
you can ask of me with a smile!

670
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:30,843
No matter how dirty the job...

671
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:06,383
That was a load of crap
about me finding a job.

672
01:17:06,383 --> 01:17:09,063
A guardian angel?
What a liar.

673
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:12,203
I should've at least gotten his number.

674
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:29,613
- See? It was you.
- Oh my goodness.

675
01:17:33,513 --> 01:17:35,203
Why do you keep following me around?

676
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:38,003
- I didn't follow you. You summoned me.
- No, I didn't.

677
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:40,773
If I had the power to do that,
I wouldn't be suffering like this.

678
01:17:40,773 --> 01:17:43,333
How would I do that?
By shaking a bell or something?

679
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:47,853
- Why would you ask me?
- Because you keep arguing with me.

680
01:17:47,853 --> 01:17:50,773
Anyway, are you sure
you're a guardian angel?

681
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:52,123
What kind of angel
are you, though?

682
01:17:52,623 --> 01:17:54,733
One that's been disgraced?
One that's on probation?

683
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:57,323
One that's new to the job?
Who are you?

684
01:17:59,023 --> 01:18:02,733
Is the part-time job at the chicken
restaurant you mentioned

685
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:04,433
actually a job on a chicken farm?

686
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,123
- No, it's not.
- Where is it then?

687
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:08,823
You gave me high hopes
as if it'd actually happen!

688
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:11,733
- You really don't know what...
- No.

689
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:13,233
Like I said, I didn't summon you.

690
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:14,733
It was you! It was!
It definitely was!

691
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,623
I've never had anything like
this happen to me before.

692
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:20,523
Was it really me?

693
01:18:21,733 --> 01:18:22,823
Really?

694
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:29,323
If it really was me, then...
what am I, exactly?

695
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:32,123
Oh, I think I know now.

696
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:33,433
What is it?

697
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,123
Tell me everything that
you can see about me.

698
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:39,623
You have a school uniform on.

699
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:40,733
What else?

700
01:18:42,303 --> 01:18:43,523
You're pretty.

701
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,023
I mean, your uniform is.

702
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:50,533
Is that all?

703
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:55,123
You don't see anything else about me?

704
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:59,323
I really must be a fairy
or something, like Tinker Bell.

705
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:08,623
Geez, he can't even take a joke?

706
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:11,523
Oh yeah, his phone number!
Damn it!

707
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:17,433
In the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, amen.

708
01:19:17,433 --> 01:19:19,123
Let us pray.

709
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:23,123
We thank you, oh Lord, for
blessing us all so much.

710
01:19:23,623 --> 01:19:28,623
Everything we do is for You, Lord,
so please give us strength.

711
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:55,233
I got it! I figured out
how I can call you!

712
01:19:57,623 --> 01:20:00,023
But still, couldn't you have called
me to a better place than this?

713
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:04,933
Are you scared?

714
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,813
I heard that Jesus and his
followers were good people.

715
01:20:06,813 --> 01:20:08,463
Stop flattering them. Didn't you say
before that you didn't believe in them?

716
01:20:08,463 --> 01:20:10,623
I came by just in case
they might be here.

717
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:18,333
Why are you walking away instead of
disappearing with sparks and such?

718
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:19,433
I can't do that here.

719
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,933
Think of this as being
a kind of a dead zone for me.

720
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:23,633
And don't follow me.

721
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:26,233
What are you planning to
do about my wish?

722
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,633
None of the three things
that I wished for were taken care of.

723
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:30,333
They'll be taken care of soon.
Same goes for your job.

724
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,033
No, not that. I mean the thing
about me getting a boyfriend.

725
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,433
You'll have to try hard
to make that happen too!

726
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:41,133
You can't just leave things like this!

727
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:46,033
I know how to summon him now.
I've got it now.

728
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,333
Oh, I didn't think that
this would work.

729
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,533
Why did you do it, then?

730
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:01,933
Wait!

731
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,933
Did you just latch onto me?

732
01:21:15,933 --> 01:21:18,333
Oh, I can't hold on
much longer! That's hot!

733
01:21:19,133 --> 01:21:21,333
I thought you'd be cold
since you were blue.

734
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,033
Don't you know that blue fire
is the hottest kind of fire?

735
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:27,633
Why not study if you have
time to fool around like this?

736
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:33,333
You know, I've always been
at the top of my classes...

737
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,533
Oh, whatever.

738
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:37,833
Can't you just give me money
instead of being a guardian angel

739
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:38,833
and call it a day?

740
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,633
I have to go because I'm busy.

741
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,033
What's got you so busy?

742
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:44,933
Well, your outfit is
a bit fancy, yes.

743
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:46,633
Tomorrow's the death anniversary
of someone that I knew.

744
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:48,333
So why are you heading
over there today?

745
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,333
Is that person's grave
out in the countryside?

746
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,633
In that place,
today is tomorrow.

747
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:54,033
When are you coming back?
Tomorrow? The day after that?

748
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:55,533
There's something
I really want to ask!

749
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:57,233
Hurry up and ask, then!

750
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,633
I know that this is
a strange question, but

751
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:05,033
I'd like for you to not
misunderstand and hear me out.

752
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,633
All right, already,
so ask away. What?

753
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:09,333
When you first showed up,
I thought you may be a god of death.

754
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:13,133
But you would have taken me away
as soon as you saw me if you were.

755
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:16,733
And then, I thought that
you may just be a ghost.

756
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:20,733
But you have a shadow.

757
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:26,733
So I thought long and hard
about what you might be.

758
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,033
And? What's your conclusion?
What am I?

759
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,533
A goblin.

760
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,533
Are you a goblin, by any chance?

761
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,833
Who are you?
Who are you, really?

762
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:43,133
It feels a bit awkward
for me to say, but...

763
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,233
I'm the Goblin's Bride.

764
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:48,733
You know that I can see spirits, right?

765
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:51,133
I had this on me...

766
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:54,833
since I was born.

767
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:58,933
I think it's because of this that ghosts
keep saying that I'm the Goblin's Bride.

768
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:00,633
You can see it, right?

769
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,133
Right here.

770
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:17,733
You can see it, right?

771
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:22,133
Prove it to me.

772
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:26,233
You want me to prove that
I'm the Goblin's Bride?

773
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:27,433
Yeah.

774
01:23:28,433 --> 01:23:29,733
How do I do that?

775
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:32,833
Do you want me to fly or something?

776
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,033
Or turn into a broomstick?

777
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,033
Do it.

778
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:38,633
I'm being really serious right now.

779
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:39,833
Me too.

780
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,833
Tell me what you see
when you look at me.

781
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,333
Are you trying to get revenge on me?

782
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,033
Tell me, already!
Tell me everything you see!

783
01:23:50,733 --> 01:23:52,233
You're tall.

784
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:53,333
And?

785
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:56,833
- Your clothes look expensive.
- And?

786
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:01,933
You look like you're in
your mid-thirties.

787
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:03,133
And?

788
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:08,333
You don't want me to tell you that
you're handsome or something, right?

789
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,033
You needed to have
the answer that I want.

790
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:17,063
But if that's all you can see,
you're not the Goblin's Bride.

791
01:24:17,063 --> 01:24:19,033
You'd be of no use
to a goblin like this.

792
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:21,633
I'm sorry that you see ghosts

793
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:24,633
but you're not supposed to
be alive anyway, so be thankful.

794
01:24:24,633 --> 01:24:29,433
You've already broken the rules
just by existing as a human being.

795
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:36,333
What if I don't want to be thankful?

796
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,633
Then you can just die
like you were supposed to.

797
01:24:39,133 --> 01:24:40,433
You're so cruel.

798
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,933
Fine, then.

799
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:48,233
Let me ask you the same
thing I asked, one more time.

800
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:51,933
Are you, by any chance, a goblin?

801
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:52,933
- No.
- You're not?

802
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,833
- I'm not.
- What are you, then?

803
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:59,233
Who are you to decide whether
you'll be with me or not?

804
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:01,333
I thought you wanted your life
to change for the better.

805
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:07,433
I'm just someone who cares just
a little bit about your crappy life.

806
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:13,833
Tune into reality instead of letting
yourself be consumed by rumors.

807
01:25:14,433 --> 01:25:16,433
Because you're not the Goblin's Bride.

808
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,333
Wait!

809
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:31,433
I'm not finished talking...

810
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:44,033
Did you just follow me
through that door?

811
01:25:44,433 --> 01:25:47,233
How... did you do that?

812
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,133
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed.

813
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:53,833
And then I followed you, Mister...

814
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,033
But what's with this place?

815
01:25:57,033 --> 01:25:59,933
Hey, I just asked you a question.
How did you come through that door?

816
01:25:59,933 --> 01:26:03,133
Oh, is this
Provence Village in Paju?

817
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,933
But still, this doesn't
seem quite right.

818
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:09,033
What's going on here?
Where is this place?

819
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:10,333
Canada.

820
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,633
Canada?

821
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:15,033
Canada...

822
01:26:15,533 --> 01:26:18,233
You mean, the place
with the maple leaf?

823
01:26:18,233 --> 01:26:19,833
The one in North America?

824
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:22,033
Is this really a different country?

825
01:26:29,933 --> 01:26:33,233
Wow. You can do this too?

826
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,433
You apparently can too.
Who are you, really?

827
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:41,133
If this really is Canada and
you really have the power to do this...

828
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,633
I've made up my mind.

829
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,233
- About what?
- I've made up my mind!

830
01:26:46,233 --> 01:26:47,233
So, about what, exactly?

831
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:48,633
I'll marry you, Mister!

832
01:26:48,633 --> 01:26:52,233
Because no matter how I think about it,
I'm pretty sure that you're a goblin.

833
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:54,633
I love you!
